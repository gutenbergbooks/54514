<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE,<br />

<small>ON THE</small><br />

<span class="large">MANNER OF WRITING DIALOGUE.</span></h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> former editions of these Dialogues were given
without a name, and under the fictitious person of
an Editor: not, the reader may be sure, for any
purpose so silly as that of imposing on the Public;
but for reasons of another kind, which it is not difficult
to apprehend.</p>

<p>However, these reasons, whatever they were,
subsisting no longer, the writer is now to appear in
his own person; and the respect he owes to the public
makes him think it fit to bespeak their acceptance
of these volumes in another manner, than he
supposed would be readily permitted to him, under
his assumed character.</p>

<p>I. In an age, like this, when most men seem
ambitious of turning writers, many persons may
think it strange that the kind of composition, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
was chiefly in use among the masters of this numerous
and stirring family, hath been hitherto neglected.</p>

<p>When the <small>ANCIENTS</small> had any thing&mdash;</p>

<p>“But what,” it will be said, “always the <i>Ancients</i>?
And are we never to take a pen in hand, but the
first question must still be, what our masters, the
ancients, have been pleased to dictate to us? <span class="smcap">One</span>
man understands, that the ancient Ode was distinguished
into several parts, called by I know
not what strange names; and then truly an English
Ode must be tricked out in the same fantastic
manner. <span class="smcap">Another</span> has heard of a wise, yet
merry, company called a Chorus, which was
always singing or preaching in the Greek Tragedies;
and then, besure, nothing will serve but
we must be sung and preached to in ours. While
a <span class="smcap">Third</span> is smitten with a tedious long-winded
thing, which was once endured under the name
of Dialogue; and strait we have Dialogues of this
formal cut, and are told withal, that no man may
presume to write them, on any other model.”</p>

<p>Thus the modern critic, with much complacency
and even gayety&mdash;But I resume the sentence I set
out with, and observe, “<span class="smcap">When the ancients</span> had
any thing to say to the world on the subject either
of morals or government, they generally chose the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
way of <span class="smcap">Dialogue</span>, for the conveyance of their instructions;
as supposing they might chance to gain
a readier acceptance in this agreeable form, than any
other.”</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">H&aelig;c adeo penitus cur&acirc; videre sagaci<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Otia qui studiis l&aelig;ti tenuere decoris,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inque <span class="smcap">Academia</span> umbrifer&acirc; nitidoque <span class="smcap">Lyceo</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fuderunt claras fœcundi pectoris artes.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Such was the address, or fancy at least, of the
wise <small>ANCIENTS</small>.</p>

<p>The <small>MODERNS</small>, on the contrary, have appeared to
reverence themselves, or their cause, too much, to
think that either stood in need of this oblique management.
No writer has the least doubt of being
favourably received in all companies, let him come
upon us in what shape he will: and, not to stand
upon ceremony, when he brings so welcome a present,
as what he calls <i>Truth</i>, with him, he obtrudes
it upon us in the direct way of Dissertation.</p>

<p>Nobody, I suppose, objects to this practice, when
important truths indeed are to be taught, and when
the abilities of the Teacher are such as may command
respect. But the case is different, when
writers presume to try their hands upon us, without
these advantages. Nay, and even with them, it can
do no hurt, when the subject is proper for familiar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
discourse, to throw it into this gracious and popular
form.</p>

<p>I have said, <i>where the subject is proper for familiar
discourse</i>; for all subjects, I think, cannot,
or should not be treated in this way.</p>

<p>It is true, the inquisitive genius of the Academic
Philosophy gave great scope to the freedom of debate.
Hence the origin of the Greek Dialogue: of
which, if <span class="smcap">Plato</span> was not the Inventor, he was, at
least, the Model.</p>

<p>This sceptical humour was presently much increased;
and every thing was now disputed, not for
<span class="smcap">Plato’s</span> reason (which was, also, his master’s) for
the sake of exposing <i>Falsehood</i> and discovering
<i>Truth</i>; but because it was pretended that nothing
could be certainly affirmed to be either <i>true</i> or
<i>false</i>.</p>

<p>And, when afterwards <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>, our other great
master of Dialogue, introduced this sort of writing
into Rome, we know that, besides his profession of
the Academic Sect, now extended and indeed outraged
into absolute scepticism, the very purpose he
had in philosophizing, and the rhetorical uses to
which he put his Philosophy, would determine him
very naturally to the same practice.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>Thus all subjects, of what nature and importance
soever, were equally discussed in the ancient
Dialogue; till matters were at length brought to
that pass, that the only end, proposed by it, was to
shew the writer’s dexterity in disputing for, or
against any opinion, without referring his disputation
to any certain use or conclusion at all.</p>

<p>Such was the character of the ancient, and especially
of the Ciceronian Dialogue; arising out of the
genius and principles of those times.</p>

<p>But for us to follow our masters in this licence
would be, indeed, to deserve the objected charge of
<i>servile Imitators</i>; since the reasons, that led them
into it, do not subsist in our case. They disputed
every thing, because they believed nothing. We
should forbear to dispute some things, because they
are such as both for their sacredness, and certainty,
no man in his senses affects to disbelieve. At least,
the Stoic <span class="smcap">Balbus</span> may teach us a decent reserve in
one instance, <i>Since</i>, as he observes, <i>it is a wicked
and impious custom to dispute against the Being,
Attributes, and Providence of God, whether it be
under an assumed character, or in one’s own</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>.</p>

<p>Thus much I have thought fit to say, to prevent
mistakes, and to shew of what kind the subjects are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
which may be allowed to enter into modern Dialogue.
They are only such, as are either, in the
strict sense of the word, <i>not</i> important, and yet
afford an ingenuous pleasure in the discussion of
them; or not <i>so</i> important as to exclude the sceptical
inconclusive air, which the decorum of polite dialogue
necessarily demands.</p>

<p>And, under these restrictions, we may treat a
number of curious and useful subjects, in this form.
The benefit will be that which the Ancients certainly
found in this practice, and which the great master
of life finds in the general way of candour and
politeness,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&mdash;parcentis viribus, atque<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Extenuantis eas consultò&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For, though Truth be not formally delivered in
Dialogue, it may be insinuated; and a capable
writer will find means to do this so effectually as,
in discussing both sides of a question, to engage the
reader insensibly on that side, where the Truth
lies.</p>

<p>II. But <i>convenience</i> is not the only consideration.
The <small>NOVELTY</small> of the thing, itself, may well
recommend it to us.</p>

<p>For, when every other species of composition has
been tried, and men are grown so fastidious as to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
receive with indifference the best modern productions,
on account of the too common form, into
which they are cast, it may seem an attempt of
some merit to revive the only one, almost, of the
ancient models, which hath not yet been made cheap
by vulgar imitation.</p>

<p>I can imagine the reader will conceive some surprise,
and, if he be not a candid one, will perhaps
express some disdain, at this pretence to Novelty,
in cultivating the <i>Dialogue-form</i>. For what, he
will say, has been more frequently aimed at in our
own, and every modern language? Has not every
art, nay, every science, been taught in this way?
And, if the vulgar use of any mode of writing be
enough to discredit it, can there be room even for
wit and genius to retrieve the honour of this trite
and hackneyed form?</p>

<p>This, no doubt, may be said; but by those who
know little of the ancient Dialogue, or who have
not attended to the true manner in which the rules
of good writing require it to be composed.</p>

<p>We have what are called Dialogues in abundance;
and the authors, for any thing I know, might please
themselves with imagining, they had copied <span class="smcap">Plato</span>
or <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>. But in our language at least (and, if I
extended the observation to the other modern ones
of most estimation, I should perhaps do them no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
wrong) I know of nothing in the way of Dialogue
that deserves to be considered by us with such
regard.</p>

<p>There are in English <span class="smcap">Three</span> Dialogues, and but
Three, that are fit to be mentioned on this occasion:
all of them excellently well composed in their
way, and, it must be owned, by the very best and
politest of our writers. And had that way been a
true one, I mean that which antiquity and good
criticism recommend to us, the Public had never
been troubled with this attempt from me, to introduce
another.</p>

<p>The Dialogues I mean are, <i>The Moralists of Lord</i>
<span class="smcap">Shaftesbury</span>; <i>Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Addison’s</span> <i>Treatise on Medals</i>;
<i>and the Minute Philosopher of Bishop</i> <span class="smcap">Berkeley</span>:
and, where is the modesty, it will be said, to attempt
the Dialogue-form, if it has not succeeded in such
hands?</p>

<p>The answer is short, and, I hope, not arrogant.
These applauded persons suffered themselves to be
misled by modern practice; and with every ability
to excel in this nice and difficult composition, have
written beneath themselves, only because they did
not keep up to the ancient standard.</p>

<p>An essential defect runs through them all. They
have taken for their speakers, not real, but <i>fictitious</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
characters; contrary to the practice of the old writers;
and to the infinite disadvantage of this mode
of writing in every respect.</p>

<p>The love of truth, they say, is so natural to the
human mind, that we expect to find the appearance
of it, even in our amusements. In some indeed,
the slenderest shadow of it will suffice: in others,
we require to have the substance presented to us.
In all cases, the degree of probability is to be estimated
from the nature of the work. Thus, for instance,
when a writer undertakes to instruct or entertain
us in the way of Dialogue, he obliges himself
to keep up to the <i>idea</i>, at least, of what he
professes. The conversation may not have <i>really</i>
been such as is represented; but we expect it to
have all the <i>forms</i> of reality. We bring with us a
disposition to be deceived (for we know his purpose
is not to recite historically, but to feign probably);
but it looks like too great an insult on our understandings,
when the writer stands upon no ceremony
with us, and refuses to be at the expence of a
little art or management to deceive us.</p>

<p>Hence the probabilities, or, what is called the
<i>decorum</i>, of this composition. We ask, “Who the
persons are, that are going to converse before us?”
“where and when the conversation passed?” and
“by what means the company came together?” If
we are let into none of these particulars, or, rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
if a way be not found to satisfy us in all of them,
we take no interest in what remains; and give the
speakers, who in this case are but a sort of Puppets,
no more credit, than the opinion we chance to entertain
of their Prompter demands from us.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when <i>such</i> persons are brought
into the scene as are well known to us, and are entitled
to our respect, and but so much address employed
in shewing them as may give us a colourable
pretence to suppose them really conversing together,
the writer himself disappears, and is even among the
first to fall into his own delusion. For thus <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>
himself represents the matter:</p>

<p>“This way of discourse,” says he, “which turns
on the authority of real persons, and those the most
eminent of former times, is, I know not how,
more interesting than any other: in so much that
in reading my own Dialogue on <i>old age</i>, I am
sometimes ready to conclude, in good earnest, it
is not I, but <span class="smcap">Cato</span> himself, who is there speaking<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>.”</p>

<p>So complete a deception, as this, requires the
hand of a master. But such <span class="smcap">Cicero</span> was; and had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
it been his design to make the highest encomium of
his own Dialogues, he could not, perhaps, have
done it so well by any other circumstance.</p>

<p>But now this advantage is wholly lost by the introduction
of <i>fictitious persons</i>. These may do in
<i>Comedy</i>; nay, they do the best there, where <i>character</i>
only, or chiefly, is designed. In <i>Dialogue</i>, we
must have real persons, and those only: for character
here is but a secondary consideration; and there
is no other way of giving weight and authority to
the conversation of the piece.</p>

<p>And here, again, <span class="smcap">Cicero</span> may instruct us; who
was so scrupulous on this head that he would not
put his discourse on <i>old age</i> into the mouth of
<span class="smcap">Tithonus</span>, although a Greek writer of name had set
him the example, <i>because</i>, as he observes, <i>a fabulous
person would have had no great authority</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>.
What then would he have said of merely fancied and
<i>ideal</i> persons, who have not so much as that shadowy
existence, which the plausibility of a current tale
bestows?</p>

<p>When I say that <i>character is but a secondary
consideration</i> in Dialogue, the reader sees I confine
myself to that species only, which was in use among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the <i>ancients</i>, properly so called; and of which
<span class="smcap">Plato</span> and <span class="smcap">Cicero</span> have left us the best models.</p>

<p>It is true, in later times, a great wit took upon
him to extend the province of Dialogue, and, like
another Prometheus<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>, (as, by an equivocal sort of
compliment, it seems, was observed of him) created
a new species; the merit of which consists in associating
two things, not naturally allied together, <i>The
severity of Philosophic Dialogue, with the humour
of the Comic</i>.</p>

<p>But as unnatural as the alliance may seem, this
sort of composition has had its admirers. In particular,
<span class="smcap">Erasmus</span> was so taken with <span class="smcap">Lucian’s</span> Dialogue,
that he has transfused its highest graces into
his own; and employed those fine arms to better
purpose against the Monks, than the forger of them
had done, against the Philosophers.</p>

<p>It must further be confessed, that this innovation
of the Greek writer had some countenance from the
genius of the old Socratic Dialogue; such I mean
as it was in the hands of <span class="smcap">Socrates</span> himself<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>; who
took his name of <span class="smcap">Ironist</span> from the continued humour
and ridicule which runs through his moral discourses.
But, besides that the Athenian’s modest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
<span class="smcap">Irony</span> was of another taste, and better suited to this
decorum of conversation, than the Syrian’s frontless
buffoonery, there was this further difference in the
two cases. <span class="smcap">Socrates</span> employed this method of ridicule,
as the only one by which he could hope to
discredit those mortal foes of reason, the <span class="smcap">Sophists</span>:
<span class="smcap">Lucian</span>, in mere wantonness, to insult its best friends,
the <span class="smcap">Philosophers</span>, and even the parent of Philosophy,
himself. The Sage would have dropped his
<span class="smcap">Irony</span>, in the company of the good and wise: The
Rhetorician is never more pleased than in confounding
both, by his intemperate <span class="smcap">Satire</span>.</p>

<p>However, there was likeness enough in the features
of each <i>manner</i>, to favour <span class="smcap">Lucian’s</span> attempt in
compounding his new Dialogue. He was not displeased,
one may suppose, to turn the comic art
of <span class="smcap">Socrates</span> against himself; though he could not
but know that the ablest masters of the Socratic
school employed it sparingly; and that, when the
illustrious Roman came to philosophize in the way
of Dialogue, he disdained to make any use of it
at all.</p>

<p>In a word, as it was taken up, to serve an occasion,
so it was very properly laid aside with it.
And even while the occasion lasted, this humorous
manner was far enough, as I observed, from being
pushed to a Scenic license; the great artists in this
way knowing very well, that, when <span class="smcap">Socrates</span> brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Philosophy from Heaven to Earth, it was not his
purpose to expose her on the stage, but to introduce
her into good company.</p>

<p>And here, to note it by the way, what has been
observed of the Ironic manner of the Socratic Dialogue,
is equally true of its <i>subtle questioning dialectic
genius</i>. This, too, had its rise from the circumstances
of the time, and the views of its author,
who employed it with much propriety and even
elegance to entrap, in their own cobweb nets, the
minute, quibbling captious sophists. How it chanced
that this part of its character did not, also, cease
with its use, but was continued by the successors in
that school, and even carried so far as to provoke
the ridicule of the wits, till, at length, it brought
on the just disgrace of the Socratic Dialogue itself,
all this is the proper subject of another inquiry.</p>

<p>Our concern, at present, is with <span class="smcap">Lucian’s</span> Dialogue;
whether he were indeed the inventor of this
species, or, after <span class="smcap">Socrates</span>, only the espouser of it.</p>

<p>The account, given above, that <i>it unites and incorporates
the several virtues of the Comic and
Philosophic manner</i>, is in <span class="smcap">Lucian’s</span> own words<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>.
Yet his Dialogue does not, as indeed it could not,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
correspond exactly to this idea. <span class="smcap">Cicero</span> thought it
no easy matter to unite <i>Philosophy with Politeness
and Good-humour</i><a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>; what then would he have
said of incorporating <i>Philosophy, with Comic Ridicule</i>?</p>

<p>To do him justice, <span class="smcap">Lucian</span> himself appears sensible
enough of the difficulty. <i>I have presumed</i>,
says he, <i>to connect and put together two things,
not very obsequious to my design, nor disposed by
any natural sympathy to bear the society of each
other</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>. And therefore we find him on all occasions
more solicitous for the success of this hazardous
enterprise, than for the credit of his invention.
Every body was ready to acknowledge the
novelty of the thing; but he had some reason to
doubt with himself, whether it were gazed at as a
monster, or admired as a just and reasonable form
of composition. So that not being able to resolve
this scruple to his satisfaction, he extricates himself,
as usual, from the perplexity, by the force of
his comic humour, and concludes at length, <i>that
he had nothing left for it but to persevere in the
choice he had once made</i>; that is, to preserve the
credit of his own consistency at least, if he could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
not prevail to have his Dialogue accepted by the judicious
reader, under the idea<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> of a consistent <i>composition</i>.</p>

<p>The ingenious writer had, surely, no better way
to take, in his distress. For the two excellencies
he meant to incorporate in his Dialogue cannot, in
a supreme degree of each, subsist together. The
one must be sacrificed to the other. Either the
philosophic part must give place to the dramatic;
or the dramatic must withdraw, or restrain itself
at least, to give room for a just display of the philosophic.</p>

<p>And this, in fact, as I observed, is the case in
<span class="smcap">Lucian’s</span> own Dialogues. They are highly dramatic,
in which part his force lay; while his Philosophy
serves only to edge his wit, or simply to
introduce it. They have, usually, for their subject,
not a <small>QUESTION DEBATED</small>; but, a <small>TENET RIDICULED</small>,
or a <small>CHARACTER EXPOSED</small>. In this view, they are
doubtless inimitable: I mean when he kept himself,
as too frequently he did not, to such <i>tenets</i> or
<i>characters</i>, as deserve to be treated in this free
manner.</p>

<p>But after all, the other species, the <i>serious, philosophic</i>
Dialogue, is the noblest and the best. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
is the <i>noblest</i>, in all views; for the dignity of its
subject, the gravity of its manner, and the importance
of its end. It is the <i>best</i>, too; I mean, it
excels most in the very truth and art of composition;
as it governs itself entirely by the rules of decorum,
and gives a just and faithful image of what
it would represent: whereas the comic Dialogue,
distorting, or, at least, aggravating the features of
its original, pleases at some expence of probability;
and at length attains its end but in part, for want
of <i>dramatic action</i>, the only medium through which
<i>humour</i> can be perfectly conveyed.</p>

<p>Thus the serious Dialogue is absolute in itself;
and fully obtains its purpose: the humorous or
characteristic, but partially; and is, at best, the
faint copy of a higher species, the <i>Comic Drama</i>.</p>

<p>However, the authority of <span class="smcap">Lucian</span> is so great,
and the manner itself so taking, that for these reasons,
but chiefly for the sake of variety, the <small>FIRST</small>
of the following Dialogues (and in part too, the
<small>SECOND</small>) pretends to be of this class.</p>

<p>But to return to our proper subject, <span class="smcap">the serious
or philosophic Dialogue</span>.</p>

<p>1. I observed (and the reason now appears) that
<i>character</i> is a subordinate consideration, in this
Dialogue. The <i>manners</i> are to be given indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
but sparingly, and, as it were, by accident. And
this grace (which so much embellishes a well-composed
work) can only be had by employing <small>REAL</small>,
<small>KNOWN</small>, and <small>RESPECTED</small> speakers. Each of these
circumstances, in the choice of a speaker, is important.
The <i>first</i>, excites our curiosity: the <i>second</i>,
affords an easy opportunity of painting the
manners by those slight and careless strokes, which
alone can be employed for this purpose, and which
would not sufficiently mark the characters of unknown
or fictitious persons: and the <i>last</i> gives weight
and dignity to the whole composition.</p>

<p>By this means, the dialogue becomes, in a high
degree, natural, and, on that account, affecting:
a thousand fine and delicate allusions to the principles,
sentiments, and history of the Dialogists
keep their characters perpetually in view: we have
a rule before us, by which to estimate the pertinence
and propriety of what is said: and we are
pleased to bear a part, as it were, in the conversation
of such persons.</p>

<p>Thus the old writers of Dialogue charm us, even
when their subjects are unpleasing, and could hardly
merit our attention: but when the topics are of general
and intimate concern to the reader, by being
discussed in this form, they create in him the
keenest appetite; and are, perhaps, read with a
higher pleasure, than we receive from most other
compositions of literary men.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>2. It being now apprehended what <i>persons</i> are
most fit to be shewn in Dialogue, the next inquiry
will be, concerning their <i>style or manner of expression</i>.
And this, in general, must be suited to
the condition and qualities of the persons themselves:
that is, it must be grave, polite, and something
raised above the ordinary pitch or tone of
conversation; for, otherwise, it would not agree to
the ideas we form of the speakers, or to the regard
we owe to <i>real</i>, <i>known</i>, and <i>respected</i> persons, seriously
debating, as the philosophic dialogue imports
in the very terms, on some useful or important
subject.</p>

<p>Thus far the case is plain enough. The conclusion
flows, of itself, from the very idea of a philosophic
conversation between such men.</p>

<p>But as it appeared that the speaker’s <i>proper manners</i>
are to be given, in this Dialogue, it may be
thought (and, I suppose, commonly is thought)
that the speaker’s <i>proper style or expression</i> should
be given, too.</p>

<p>Here the subject begins to be a little nice; and
we must distinguish between the <i>general cast</i> of
expression, and its <i>smaller and more peculiar features</i>.</p>

<p>As to the <i>general cast or manner of speaking</i>,
it may be well to preserve some resemblance of it;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
for it results so immediately from the speaker’s character,
and sometimes makes so essential a part of
it, that the <i>manners</i> themselves cannot, otherwise,
be sufficiently expressed.</p>

<p>Accordingly <span class="smcap">Cicero</span> tells us, that, in his Dialogues
of the <i>complete Orator</i>, he had <i>endeavoured
to shadow out</i>, that is, give the outline, as it were,
of the kind of eloquence, by which his chief
speakers, <span class="smcap">Crassus</span> and <span class="smcap">Antonius</span>, were severally distinguished<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>.
This attention has certainly no ill
effect when the <i>manners of speaking</i>, as here, are
sufficiently distinct, and generally known. It was,
besides, essentially necessary in this Dialogue,
where the subject is, of eloquence itself; and where
the principal persons appeared, and were accordingly
to be represented, in the light and character of
<i>speakers</i>; that is, where their different kinds or
manners of speaking were, of course, to be expressed.</p>

<p>In Dialogues on other subjects, <span class="smcap">Cicero</span> himself
either neglects this rule, or observes it with less
care<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>; and this difference of conduct is plainly justified,
from the reason of the thing.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>But now when the question is, of the <i>smaller
features and more peculiar qualities of style or expression</i>,
it will be found that the writer of Dialogue
is under no obligation, either from the reason
of the thing, or the best authorities, to affect a resemblance
of that kind.</p>

<p>Authorities, I think, there are none, or none at
least that deserve to be much regarded; though I
remember what has been observed of an instance or
two of this sort, in some of <span class="smcap">Plato’s</span> Dialogues, where
his purpose is, to <i>expose a character</i>, not to <i>debate
a philosophic question</i>: and for <i>the impropriety of
the thing itself</i>, it may appear from the following
considerations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>In general, the reason, why <i>character</i> is preserved
in this Dialogue, is, because such speakers,
as are introduced in it, cannot be supposed to converse
for any time on a subject of importance without
discovering somethings of their own <i>peculiar
manners</i>; though the occasion may not be warming
enough to throw them out with that distinctness
and vivacity, which we expect in the progress of a
dramatic plot. But as to the <i>language of conversation</i>,
it is so much the same between persons of
education and politeness, that, whether the subject
be interesting, or otherwise, all that you can expect
is that the <i>general cast of expression</i> will be somewhat
tinctured by the <i>manners</i>, which shine through
it; but by no means that the smaller differences,
the nicer peculiarities of style, will be shewn.</p>

<p>Or, we may take the matter thus:</p>

<p>The reason, why the <i>general cast or kind of expression</i>
is different in two speakers, is, because
their <i>characters</i> are different, too. But <i>character</i>
has no manner of influence, in the ease and freedom
of conversation, on the <i>idiomatic differences</i>
of expression; which flow not from the <i>manners</i>,
but from some degree of study and affectation, and
only characterize their written and artificial works.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, if <span class="smcap">Sallust</span> and <span class="smcap">Cicero</span> had
come together in conversation, the <i>former</i> would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
certainly have dropped his <i>new words and pointed
sentences</i>: and the <i>latter</i> his <i>numerous oratorial
periods</i>. All that might be expected to appear, is,
that <span class="smcap">Sallust’s</span> expression would be shorter and more
compact; <span class="smcap">Cicero’s</span> more gracious and flowing, agreeably
to the characters of the two men.</p>

<p>But there is a further reason why these <i>characteristic
peculiarities of style</i> must not be exhibited,
or must be infinitely restrained at least, in the sort
of composition we are now considering. It is, that
the studied imitation of such peculiarities would be
what we call <i>mimickry</i>; and would therefore border
upon <i>ridicule</i>, the thing of all others which the
genius of this Dialogue most abhors. In Comedy
itself, the most exact writers do not condescend to
this minute imitation. <span class="smcap">Terence’s</span> characters all express
themselves, I think, with equal elegance:
even his slaves are made to speak as good Latin, as
their masters. In the serious Dialogue, then, which,
from its nature, is, in a much lower degree, <i>mimetic</i>,
that minute attention can by no means be required.
It will be sufficient that the speakers express themselves
in <i>the same manner</i>, that is, (provided the
<i>general cast</i> of expression be suited to their respective
characters) <i>in the writer’s own</i>.</p>

<p>If there be any exception from this rule, it must
be, when the peculiarities of expression are so great,
and so notorious, that the reader could hardly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
acknowledge the speaker in any other dress, than
that of his own style. Hence it is possible, though
<span class="smcap">Cicero</span> has left us no example of this sort, that if,
in the next age, any one had thought fit to introduce
<span class="smcap">M&aelig;cenas</span> into Dialogue, he might perhaps have
been allowed to colour his language with some of
those <i>spruce turns and negligent affectations</i>, by
which, as a writer, he was so well known. It is, at
least, on this principle that the Author of the following
Dialogues must rest his apology for having
taken such liberty, in <i>one or two instances, only</i>:
in which, however, he has confined his imitation to
the single purpose of exhibiting some degree of likeness
to their acknowledged manner of expression,
without attempting to expose it in any strong or invidious
light. And, after all, if even this liberty,
so cautiously taken, be thought too much, he will
not complain of his critics; since the fault, if it be
one, was committed rather in compliance with what
he supposed might be the public judgment, than
with his own.</p>

<p>The reader has now before him a sketch of what
I conceive to be the <i>character</i> of the ancient philosophic
Dialogue; which, in one word, may be
said to be, “An imitated, and mannered conversation
between certain real, known, and respected
persons, on some useful or serious subject, in an
elegant, and suitably adorned, but not characteristic
style.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>At least, I express, as I can, my notion of <span class="smcap">Cicero’s</span>
Dialogue, which unites these several characters;
and, by such union, has effected, as it seems to me,
all that the nature of this composition requires or
admits.</p>

<p>This, I am sensible, is saying but little, on the
subject. But I pretend not to do justice to <span class="smcap">Cicero’s
Dialogues</span>; which are occasionally set off by that
lively, yet chaste colouring of the <i>manners</i>, and
are, besides, all over sprinkled with that exquisite
grace of, what the Latin writers call, <i>urbanity</i>, (by
which, they meant as well what was most polite in
the <i>air</i> of conversation, as in the language of it)
that there is nothing equal to them, in Antiquity
itself: and I have sometimes fancied, that even
<span class="smcap">Livy’s</span> Dialogues<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>, if they had come down to us,
would perhaps have lost something, on a comparison
with these master-pieces of <span class="smcap">Cicero’s</span> pen.</p>

<p>3. But to this apology for the ancient Dialogue,
I suspect it will be replied, “That though, in the
hands of the Greek and Latin writers, it might,
heretofore, have all this grace and merit, yet who
shall pretend to revive it in our days? or, how shall
we enter into the spirit of this composition, for which
there is no encouragement, nor so much as the
countenance of example in real life? No man writes
well, but from his own experience and observation:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
and by whom is the way of dialogue now practised?
or, where do we find such precedents of grave and
continued conversation in modern times?”</p>

<p>A very competent judge, and one too, who was
himself, as I have observed, an adventurer in this
class of composition, puts the objection home in the
following words:</p>

<p>“The truth is,” says he, “it would be an abominable
falsehood, and belying of the age, to put
so much good sense together in any <i>one</i> conversation,
as might make it hold out steadily, and with
plain coherence, for an hour’s time, till any <i>one</i>
subject had been rationally examined<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>.”</p>

<p>Nor is this the only difficulty. <i>Another</i> occurs,
from the prevailing manners of modern times, which
are over-run with respect, compliment, and ceremony.
“Now put <i>compliments</i>,” says the same
writer, “put <i>ceremony</i> into a Dialogue, and see
what will be the effect! This is the plain <i>dilemma</i>
against that ancient manner of writing&mdash;if we
avoid ceremony, we are unnatural: if we use it,
and appear as we naturally are, as we salute, and
meet, and treat one another, we hate the sight<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>.”</p>

<p>These considerations are to the purpose; and
shew perhaps in a mortifying manner, that the modern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
writers of Dialogue, the very best of them,
cannot aspire to the unrivalled elegance of the ancient;
as being wholly unfurnished of many advantages,
to this end, which they enjoyed. But
still the <i>form</i> of writing itself is neither impracticable,
nor unnatural: and there are certain <i>means</i>,
by which the disadvantages, complained of, may be
lessened at least, if not entirely removed.</p>

<p>To begin with the <small>LAST</small>. It is very true, that the
constraint of a formal and studied civility is foreign
to the genius of this sort of composition; and it is,
also, as true, that somewhat of this constrained civility
is scarce separable from a just copy and faithful
picture of conversation in our days. The reason
of which is to be gathered from the nature of our
policies and governments. For conversation, I
mean the serious and manly sort, as well as eloquence,
is most cultivated and thrives best amidst
the quality of conditions in republican and popular
states.</p>

<p>And, though this inconvenience be less perceived
by us of this free country than by most others, yet
something of it will remain wherever monarchy,
with its consequent train of subordinate and dependent
ranks of men, subsists.</p>

<p>Now the proper remedy in the case is, to bring
such men only together in Dialogue as are of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
same rank; or at least to class our speakers with
such care as that any great inequality in that respect
may be compensated by some other; such as the
superiority of age, wisdom, talents, or the like. A
Chancellor of <i>England</i> and a Country Justice, or
even a Lord and his Chaplain, could hardly be
shewn in Dialogue, without incurring some ridicule.
But a Judge and a Bishop, one would hope, might
be safely brought together; and if a great Philosopher
should enter into debate with a lettered Man
of Quality, the indecorum would not be so violent
as to be much resented.</p>

<p>But the influence of modern manners reaches
even to names and the ordinary forms of address.
In the Greek and Roman Dialogues, it was permitted
to accost the greatest persons by their obvious
and familiar appellations. <span class="smcap">Alcibiades</span> had no more
addition, than <span class="smcap">Socrates</span>: and <span class="smcap">Brutus</span> and <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar</span>
lost nothing of their dignity from being applied to in
those direct terms. The moderns, on the contrary,
have their guards and fences about them; and we
hold it an incivility to approach them without some
decent periphrasis, or ceremonial title&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&mdash;&mdash;gaudent pr&aelig;nomine molles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Auricul&aelig;.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was principally, I believe, for this reason, that
modern writers of Dialogue have had recourse to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
fictitious names and characters, rather than venture
on the use of real ones: the <i>former</i> absolving them
from this cumbersome ceremony, which, in the
case of the <i>latter</i>, could not so properly be laid
aside. <span class="smcap">Pal&aelig;mon</span> and <span class="smcap">Philander</span>, for instance, are
not only well-sounding words; but slide as easily
into a sentence, and as gracefully too, as <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>
and <span class="smcap">Atticus</span>: while the <i>Mr’s</i> and the <i>Sirs</i>, nay his
<i>Grace</i>, his <i>Excellency</i>, or his <i>Honour</i><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>, of modern
Dialogue, have not only a formality that hurts the
ease of conversation, but a harshness too, which is
somewhat offensive to a well-tuned Attic or Roman
ear.</p>

<p>All this will be allowed; and yet, to speak plainly
and with that freedom which ancient manners indulge,
the barbarity of these forms is not worse than
the pedantry of taking such disgust at them. And
there are ways, too, by which the most offensive
circumstances in this account may be so far qualified
as to be almost overlooked, or at least endured.
What <i>these</i> are, the capable and intelligent reader
or writer is not to be told; and none but such would
easily apprehend.</p>

<p>To come then to the <small>OTHER</small> objection of Lord
<span class="smcap">Shaftesbury</span>, which is more considerable.</p>

<p>It would be a manifest falsehood, he thinks, and
directly against the truth both of art and nature, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
engage the moderns in a grave discourse of any
length. And it is true, the great men of our time
do not, like the Senators of ancient <i>Rome</i>, spend
whole days in learned debate and formal disputation:
yet their meetings, especially in private parties,
with their friends, are not so wholly frivolous, but
that they sometimes discourse seriously, and even
pursue a subject of learning or business, not with
coherence only, but with some care. And will not
this be ground enough for a capable writer to go
upon, in reviving the way of Dialogue between such
men?</p>

<p>But, to give the most probable air to his fiction,
he may find it necessary to recede from the strict
imitation of his originals, in one instance.</p>

<p>It may be advisable not to take for his speakers,
<i>living persons</i>; I mean, persons, however respectable,
of his own age. We may fancy of the dead,
what we cannot so readily believe of the living.
And thus, by endeavouring a little to deceive ourselves,
we may come to think that natural, which
is not wholly incredible; and may admit the writer’s
invention for a picture, though a studied and flattering
one, it may be, of real life.</p>

<p>In short, it may be a good rule in modern Dialogue,
as it was in ancient Tragedy, to take our
subjects, and choose our persons, out of former
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
times. And, under the prejudice of that opinion
which is readily entertained of such subjects and
characters, an artist may contrive to pass that upon
us for <i>Fact</i>, which was only ingenious <i>Fiction</i>; and
so wind up his piece to the perfection of ancient
Dialogue, without departing too widely from the
decorum and truth of conversation in modern life.</p>

<p>Such at least is the <span class="smcap">Idea</span>, which the Author of
these Dialogues has formed to himself of the manner
in which this exquisite sort of composition may be
attempted by more successful writers. For to conceive
an excellence, and to copy it, he understands
and laments, are very different things.</p>

<span class="medium"><span class="smcap">Dr. HENRY MORE, EDMUND WALLER, Esq.</span></span></h2>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Enough</span>, enough, my friend, on the good
old chapter of <i>Sincerity and Honour</i>. Your
rhetoric, and not your reasoning, is too much
for me. Believe it, your fine stoical lessons
must all give way to a little common sense, I
mean, to a prudent accommodation of ourselves
to times and circumstances; which, whether
you will dignify it with the name of philosophy,
or no, is the only method of living with credit
in the world, and even with safety.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>Accommodation is, no doubt, a good word
to stand in the place of insincerity. But, pray,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
in which of the great moral masters have you
picked up this term, and, much more, the virtuous
practice, it so well expresses?</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>I learnt it from the great master of life, <small>EXPERIENCE</small>:
A doctor, little heard of in the
schools, but of more authority with men of
sense, than all the solemn talkers of the porch,
or cloister, put together.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>After much reserve, I confess, you begin to
express yourself very clearly. But, good Sir,
not to take up your conclusion too hastily,
have the patience to hear&mdash;</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>Have I not, then, heard, and sure with patience
enough, your studied harangues on this
subject? You have discoursed it, I must own,
very plausibly. But the impression, which
fine words make, is one thing, and the conviction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
of reason, another. And, not to waste
more time in fruitless altercation, let <small>ME</small>, if
you please, read you a lecture of morals: not
out of ancient books, or the visions of an unpractised
philosophy, but from the schools of
business and real life. Such a view of things
will discredit these high nations, and may serve,
for the future, to amend and rectify all your
systems.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>Commend me to a man of the world, for a
rectifier of moral systems!&mdash;Yet, if it were
only for the pleasure of being let into the secrets
of this new doctrine of <i>Accommodation</i>,
I am content to become a <i>patient</i> hearer, in
my turn; and the rather, as the day, which
you see, wears apace, will hardly give leave for
interruption, or indeed afford you time enough
for the full display of your wit on this extraordinary
subject.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>We have day enough before us, for the business
in hand. ’Tis true, this wood-land walk
has not the charms, which you lately bestowed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
on a certain <i>philosophical garden</i><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>. But the
heavens are as clear, and the air, that blows
upon us, as fresh, as in that fine evening which
drew your friends abroad, and engaged them in
a longer debate, than that with which I am
now likely to detain you. For, indeed, I have
only to lay before you the result of my own
experience and observation. All my arguments
are plain facts, which are soon told, and about
which there can be no dispute. You shall
judge for yourself, how far they will authorize
the conclusion I mean to draw from them.</p>

<p>The point, I am bold enough to maintain
against you philosophers, is, briefly, this;
“That <i>sincerity</i>, or a scrupulous regard to
<i>truth</i> in all our conversation and behaviour,
how specious soever it may be in theory, is
a thing impossible in practice; that there is
no living in the world on these terms; and
that a man of business must either quit the
scene, or learn to temper the strictness of
your discipline with some reasonable accommodations.
It is exactly the dilemma of the
poet,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vivere si recte nescis, discede peritis;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>of all which I presume, as I said, to offer my
own experience, as the shortest and most convincing
demonstration.”</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>The subject, I confess, is fairly delivered,
and nothing can be juster than this appeal to
experience, provided you do not attempt to
delude yourself or me by throwing false colours
upon it.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>It will be your business to remonstrate against
these arts, if you discover any such. My intention
is to proceed in the way of a direct and
simple recital.</p>

<p>“I was born, as you know, of a good family,
and to the inheritance of this paternal seat<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>,
with the easy fortune that belongs to it. To
this, I succeeded but too soon by the untimely
loss of an excellent father. His death, however,
did not deprive me of those advantages
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
which are thought to arise from a strict and
virtuous education. This care devolved on
my mother, a woman of great prudence, who
provided for my instruction in letters and every
other accomplishment. I was, of myself,
enough inclined to books, and was supposed to
have some parts which deserved cultivation. I
was accordingly trained in the study of those
writings, which are the admiration of men of
elegant minds and refined morals. I was a
tolerable master of the languages, in which
they are composed; and, I may venture to say,
was at least imbued with their notions and
principles, if I was not able at that time to
catch the spirit of their composition: all which
was confirmed in me, by the constant attendance
and admonitions of the best tutors, and
the strict discipline of your colleges. I mention
these things to shew you, that I was not
turned loose into the world, as your complaint
of men of business generally is, unprincipled
and uninstructed; and that what austere men
might afterwards take for some degree of libertinism
in my conduct, is not to be charged
on the want of a sober or even learned education.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>I understand you mean to take no advantage
of that plea, if what follows be not answerable
to so high expectations.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>The season was now come, when my rank
and fortune, together with the solicitations of
my friends, drew me forth, though reluctantly,
from the college into the world. I was then,
indeed, under twenty; but so practised in the
best things, and so enamoured of the moral
lessons which had been taught me, that I carried
with me into the last parliament of king
James, not the showy accomplishments of learning
only, but the high enthusiasm of a warm
and active virtue. Yet the vanity, it may be, of a
young man, distinguished by some advantages,
and conscious enough of them, was, for a time,
the leading principle with me. In this disposition,
it may be supposed, I could not be
long without desiring an introduction to the
court. It was not a school of that virtue I had
been used to, yet had some persons in it of
eminent worth and honour. A vein of poetry,
which seemed to flow naturally from me, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
that by which I seemed most ambitious to recommend
myself<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>. And occasions quickly
offered for that purpose. But this was a play
of ingenuity in which the heart had no share.
I made complimentary verses on the great lords
and ladies of the court, with as much simplicity
and as little meaning as my bows in the drawing
room, and thought it a fine thing to be taken
notice of, as a wit, in the fashionable circles.
In the mean time, the corruptions of a loose
disorderly court gave me great scandal. And
the abject flatteries, I observed in some of the
highest stations and gravest characters, filled
me with indignation. As an instance of this,
I can never forget the resentment, that fired
my young breast at the conversation you have
often heard me say I was present at, betwixt
the old king, and two of his court prelates<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>.
And if the prudent and witty turn, the venerable
bishop of <i>Winchester</i> gave to the discourse,
had not atoned, in some measure, for
the rank offensive servility of the <i>other</i>, it had
been enough to determine me, forthwith, to an
implacable hatred of kings and courts for ever.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>It must be owned the provocation was very
gross, and the offence taken at it no more than
a symptom of a generous and manly virtue.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>It left a deep impression on my mind; yet
it did not hinder me from appearing at court
in the first years of the following reign, when
the vanity of a thoughtless muse, rather than
any relaxation of my ancient manners, drew
from me, again, some occasional panegyrics
on greatness; which being presented in verse,
I thought would hardly be suspected of flattery.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>This indulgence of a <i>thoughtless muse</i> (as
you call it) was not without its danger. I am
afraid this must pass for the first instance of
your sacrificing to <span class="smcap">Insincerity</span>.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>Your fears are too hasty. This was still a
trial of my wit: and after a few wanton circles,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
as it were to breathe and exercise my muse, I
drew her in from these amusements to a stricter
manage and more severe discipline. The long
interval of parliaments now followed; and in
this suspension of business I applied myself to
every virtuous pursuit that could be likely to
improve my mind, or purify my morals. Believe
me, I cannot to this day, without pleasure,
reflect on the golden hours, I passed in
the society of such accomplished men as <span class="smcap">Falkland</span>,
<span class="smcap">Hyde</span>, and <span class="smcap">Chillingworth</span>. And, for
my more retired amusements at this place, you
will judge of the good account I might render of
these, when I add, they were constantly shared
with that great prelate, who now, with so much
dignity, fills the throne of <i>Winchester</i><a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>This enthusiasm of your’s is catching, and
raises in me an incredible impatience to come
at the triumphs of a virtue, trained and perfected
in her best school, the conversations of
heroes and sages.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>You shall hear. The jealousies, that had
alarmed the nation for twelve years, were now
to have a vent given them, by the call of the
parliament in <i>April 1640</i>. As the occasion,
on which it met, was in the highest degree interesting,
the assembly itself was the most august,
that perhaps had ever deliberated on
public councils. There was a glow of honour,
of liberty, and of virtue in all hearts, in all
faces: and yet this fire was tempered with so
composed a wisdom, and so sedate a courage,
that it seemed a synod of heroes; and, as some
would then say of us, could only be matched
by a senate of old Rome in its age of highest
glory. To this parliament I had the honour
to be deputed, whither I went with high-erected
thoughts, and a heart panting for glory
and the true service of my country. The dissolution,
which so unhappily followed, served
only to increase this ardour. So that, on our
next meeting in <i>November</i>, I went freely and
warmly into the measures of those, who were
supposed to mean the best. I voted, I spoke,
I impeached<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>. In a word, I gave a free scope
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
to those generous thoughts and purposes which
had been collecting in me for so many years,
and was in the foremost rank of those, whose
pulse beat highest for liberty, and who were
most active for the interest of the public.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>This was indeed a triumph, the very memory
of which warms you to this moment. So
bright a flame was not easily extinguished.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>It continued for some time in all its vigour.
High as my notions were of public liberty,
they did not transport me, with that zeal which
prevailed on so many others, to act against the
just prerogative of the crown, and the ancient
constitution. I owe it to the conversation and
influence of the excellent society, before-mentioned,
that neither the spirit, the sense, nor,
what is more, the relationship and intimate acquaintance
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Hampden</span><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>, could ever bias
me to his deeper designs, or any irreverence to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
the unhappy king’s person. Many things concurred
to preserve me in this due mean. The
violent tendencies of many councils on the parliament’s
side; many gracious and important
compliances on the king’s; the great examples
of some who had most authority with good
men; and, lastly, my own temper, which, in
its highest fervours, always inclined to moderation;
these and other circumstances kept me
from the excesses, on either hand, which so
few were able to avoid in that scene of public
confusion.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>This moderation carries with it all the marks
of a real and confirmed virtue.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>I rather expected you would have considered
it as another <i>sacrifice to Insincerity</i>. Such, I
remember, was the language of many at that
time. The enthusiasts on both sides agreed to
stigmatize this temper with the name of <i>Neutrality</i>.
Yet this treatment did not prevent
me, when the war broke out, from taking a
course, which I easily foresaw, would tend to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
increase such suspicions; for now, to open a
fresh scene to you, I had assumed, if not new
principles, yet new notions of the manner in
which good policy required me to exert my
old ones. The general virtue, or what had the
appearance of it at least, had hitherto made
plain-dealing an easy and convenient conduct.
But things were now changed. The minds of
all men were on fire: deep designs were laid,
and no practice stuck at that might be proper
to advance the execution of them. In this situation
of affairs, what could simple honesty
do, but defeat the purpose and endanger the
safety of its master? I now, first, began to reflect
that this was a virtue for other times: at
least, that not to qualify it, in some sort, was,
at such a juncture, not honesty, but imprudence:
and when I had once fallen into this
train of thinking, it is wonderful how many
things occurred to me to justify and recommend
it. The humour of acting always on
one principle was, I said to myself, like that
of sailing with one wind: whereas the expert
mariner wins his way by plying in all directions,
as occasions serve, and making the best
of all weathers. Then I considered with myself
the bad policy, in such a conjuncture, of
<span class="smcap">Cato</span> and <span class="smcap">Brutus</span>, and easily approved in my
own mind the more pliant and conciliating method
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
of <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>. Those stoics, thought I, ruined
themselves and their cause by a too obstinate
adherence to their system. The liberal and
more enlarged conduct of the academic, who
took advantage of all winds that blew in that
time of civil dissension, had a chance at least
for doing his country better service. Observation,
as well as books, furnish me with these
reflections. I perceived with what difficulty
the Lord <span class="smcap">Falkland’s</span> rigid principles had suffered
him to accept an office of the greatest
consequence to the public safety<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>: and I understood
to what an extreme his scruples had
carried him in the discharge of it<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>. This, concluded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
I, can never be the office of virtue in
such a world, and in such a period. And then
that of the poet, so skilled in the knowledge of
life, occurred to me,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">&mdash;aut virtus nomen inane est,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aut decus et pretium recte petit <small>EXPERIENS</small> vir;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>that is, as I explained it, “The man of a ready
and dexterous turn in affairs; one who knows
how to take advantage of all circumstances,
and is not restrained, by his bigotry, from varying
his conduct, as occasions serve, and
making, as it were, <i>experiments</i> in business.”</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>You poets, I suppose, have an exclusive right
to explain one another; or these words might
seem to bear a more natural interpretation.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>You will understand from this account,
which I have opened so particularly to you, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
what reasons I was induced to alter my plan,
or rather to pursue it with those arts of prudence
and address, which the turn of the times
had now rendered necessary. The conclusion
was, I resolved to pursue steadily the king’s,
which at the same time was manifestly the nation’s
interest, and yet to keep fair with the
parliament, and the managers on that side;
for this appeared the likeliest way of doing him
real service. And yet some officious scruples,
which forced themselves upon me at first, had
like to have fixed me in other measures. In
the stream of those who chose to desert the
houses rather than share in the violent counsels
that prevailed in them, the general disgust had
also carried me to withdraw myself. But this
start of zeal was soon over. I presently saw,
and found means to satisfy the king, that it
would be more for his service that I should return
to the parliament. I therefore resumed
my seat, and took leave (to say the truth, it
was not denied me by the house, who had
their own ends to serve by this indulgence<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>) to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
reason and debate in all points with great freedom.
At the same time my affections to the
common interest were not suspected; for,
having no connexion with the court, nobody
thought of charging me with private views;
and not forgetting, besides, to cultivate a good
understanding with the persons of chief credit
in the house, the plainness I used could only
be taken for what it was, an honest and parliamentary
liberty. This situation was, for a
time, very favourable to me: for the king’s
friends regarded me as the champion of their
cause; whilst the prudence of my carriage towards
the leading members secured me, in a
good degree, from their jealousy.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>Your policy, I observe, had now taken a
more refined turn. The juncture of affairs
might possibly justify this address: but the
ground you stood upon was slippery; and I
own myself alarmed at what may be the consequence
of this solicitous pursuit of popularity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>No exception, I think, can be fairly taken at
the methods by which I pursued it. However,
this <i>popularity</i> it was, as you rightly divine,
which drew upon me all the mischiefs that followed.
For the application of all men, disposed
to the king’s service, was now made to
me. I had an opportunity, by this means, of
knowing the characters and views of particular
persons, and of getting an insight into the true
state of the king’s affairs. And these advantages,
in the end, drove me on the project,
which, on the discovery, came to be called my
<i>Plot</i>: an event, which, with all its particulars,
you understand too well to need any information
from me about it.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>The story, as it was noised abroad, I am no
stranger to: but this being one of those occasions,
as they say, in which both your policy
and virtue were put to the sharpest trial, it
would be much to the purpose you have in view
by this recital, to favour me with your own account
of it.

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>To lead you through all particulars, would
not suit with the brevity you require of me.
But something I will say to obviate the misconceptions
you may possibly have entertained of
this business<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>. For the plot itself, the utmost
of my design was only to form such a combination
among the honest and well-affected of
all sorts, as might have weight enough to incline
the houses to a peace, and prevent the
miseries that were too certainly to be apprehended
from a civil war. It was never in my
thoughts to surprize the parliament or city by
force, or engage the army in the support and
execution of my purpose. But my design in
this affair, though the fury of my enemies, and
the fatal jealousy of the time, would not suffer
it to be rightly understood, is not that which
my friends resented, and which most men were
disposed to blame in me. It was my behaviour
afterwards, and the obliquity of some means
which I found expedient to my own safety,
that exposed me to so rude a storm of censure.
It continues, I know, to beat upon me even at
this distance. But the injustice hath arisen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
from the force of vulgar prejudices, and from
the want of entering into those enlarged principles,
on which it was necessary for me to
proceed in that juncture.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>Yet the ill success of this plot itself might
have shewn you, what the design of acting
on these <i>enlarged principles</i> was likely to come
to. It was an unlucky experiment, this, you
had made in the <i>new</i> arts of living; and should
have been a warning to you, not to proceed in
a path which, at the very entrance of it, had involved
you in such difficulties.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>No, it was not the new path, you object to
me, but the good old road of Sincerity, which
misled me into those brambles. I, in the
simplicity of my heart, thought it my duty to
adhere to the injured king’s cause, and believed
my continuance in parliament the fairest,
as well as the likeliest method, that could be
taken to support it. Had I temporized so far
as either to desert my prince, and strike in with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
the parliament, or, on the other hand, had left
the house and gone with the seceders to <i>Oxford</i>,
either way I had been secure. But resolving,
as I did, to hold my principles, and follow my
judgment, I fell into those unhappy circumstances,
from which all the dexterity I afterwards
assumed was little enough to deliver me.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>But if your intentions were so pure, and the
methods, by which you resolved to prosecute
them, so blameless, how happened it that any
plot could be worked up of so much danger to
your life and person?</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>This was the very thing I was going to explain
to you. My intentions towards the parliament
were fair and honourable: as I retained
my seat there, I could not allow myself in the
use of any but parliamentary methods to promote
the cause I had undertaken. And this,
as I said, was the whole purpose of the <i>combination</i>,
which was made the pretence to ruin
me: for my unhappy project of a reconciliation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
was so inextricably confounded with another of
more dangerous tendency, the <i>commission of
array</i>, sent at that time from <i>Oxford</i>, that
nothing, I presently saw, could possibly disentangle
so perplexed a business, or defeat the
malice of my enemies, if I attempted, in the
more direct way, to stand on my defence.
Presumptions, if not proofs, they had in
abundance: the consternation of all men was
great; their rage, unrelenting; and the general
enthusiasm of the time, outrageous. Consider
all this, and see what chance there was
for escaping their injustice, if I had restrained
myself to the sole use of those means, which
you men of the cloister magnify so much, under
I know not what names of <i>Sincerity</i> and <i>Honour</i>.
And, indeed, this late experience, of what was
to be expected from the way of plain dealing,
had determined me, henceforth, to take a different
route; and, since I had drawn these
mischiefs on myself by <i>Sincerity</i>, to try what
a little management could do towards bringing
me out of them.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>It was not, I perceive, without cause, that
the subtlety you had begun to have recourse to,
filled me with apprehensions. Sincerity and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
Honour, Mr. <span class="smcap">Waller</span>, are plain things, and
hold no acquaintance with this ingenious
casuistry.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>What, not in such a situation? It should
seem then, as if you moralists conceived a man
owed nothing to himself: that <i>self-preservation</i>
was not what God and Nature have made it,
the first and most binding of all laws: that a
man’s family, not to say his country, have no
interest in the life of an innocent and deserving
citizen; and, in one word, that <i>prudence</i> is
but an empty name, though you give it a place
among your <i>cardinal virtues</i>. All this must
be concluded before you reject, as unlawful,
the means I was forced upon, at this season,
for my defence: means, I presume to say, so
sagely contrived, and, as my very enemies will
own, executed so happily, that I cannot to this
day reflect on my conduct in that affair without
satisfaction.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>Yet it had some consequences which a man
of your generosity would a little startle at.&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>I understand you: my friends&mdash;But I shall
answer that objection in its place.</p>

<p>Let me at present go on with the particulars
of my defence. The occasion, as you see, was
distressful to the last degree. To deny or defend
myself from the charge was a thing impossible.
What remained then but to confess
it, and in so frank and ample a manner, as
might bespeak the pity or engage the protection
of my accusers? I resolved to say nothing but
the <i>truth</i>; and, if ever the <i>whole</i> truth may
be spoken, it is when so alarming an occasion
calls for it. Besides, what had others, who
might be affected by the discovery, to complain
of? I disclaimed no part of the guilt myself:
nor could any confession be made, that did
not first and chiefly affect me. And if I, who
was principal in the contrivance, had the best
chance for escaping by such confession, what
had they, who were only accomplices, to apprehend
from it? Add to this, that the number
and credit of the persons, who were
charged with having a share in the design, were,
of all others, the likeliest considerations to prevail
with the houses to drop the further prosecution
of it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>Well, the discovery had great effects. But
there was no stopping here. Penitence, as well
as confession, is expected from a sinner. I had
to do with hypocrites of the worst sort. What
fairer weapons, then, than hypocrisy and dissimulation?
I counterfeited the strongest remorse,
and with a life and spirit that disposed
all men to believe, and most to pity me. My
trial was put off in very compassion to my
disorder; which, in appearance, was so great,
that some suspected my understanding had
been affected by it. In this contrivance I had
two views; to gain time for my defence, and
to keep it off till the fury of my prosecutors
was abated. In this interval, indeed, some of
my accomplices suffered. But how was it
possible for me to apprehend that, when, if
any, I myself might expect to have fallen the
first victim of their resentment?</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>If this apology satisfy yourself, I need not
interrupt your story with any exceptions.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>It was, in truth, the only thing which afflicted
me in the course of this whole business.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
But time and reflection have reconciled me to
what was, in some sense, occasioned, but certainly
not intended, by me. And it would be
a strange morality that should charge a man
with the undesigned consequences of his own
actions.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>And were all the symptoms of a disturbed
mind, you made a shew of, then entirely counterfeit?</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>As certainly as those of the Roman <span class="smcap">Brutus</span>,
who, to tell you the truth, was my example
on that occasion. It was the business of both
of us to elude the malice of our enemies, and
reserve ourselves for the future service of our
respective countries.</p>

<p>But all I have told you was only a prelude
to a further, and still more necessary, act of
dissimulation. Had the house been left to itself,
it might possibly have absolved me, on
the merits of so large a confession, and so
lively a repentance. But I had to do with
another class of men, with holy inquisitors of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
sordid minds, and sour spirits; priestly reformers,
whose sense was noise, and religion
fanaticism, and that too fermented with the
leven of earthly avarice and ambition. These had
great influence both within doors and without,
and would regard what had hitherto passed as
nothing, if I went not much further. To
these, having begun in so good a train, I was
now to address myself. I had studied their
humours, and understood to a tittle the arts
that were most proper to gain them.</p>

<p>The first step to the countenance and good
liking of these restorers of primitive parity
was, I well knew, the most implicit subjection
both of will and understanding. I magnified
their gifts, I revered their sanctity. I debased
myself with all imaginable humility: I extolled
them with the grossest flattery.</p>

<p>Having thus succeeded to my wish in drawing
the principal of these saints around me, I
advanced further: I sought their instruction,
solicited their advice, and importuned their
ghostly consolation. This brought me into
high favour; they regarded me as one, who
wished and deserved to be enlightened: they
strove which should impart most of their lights
and revelations to me. I besought them to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
expound, and pray, and preach before me:
nay, I even preached, and prayed, and expounded
before them. I out-canted the best-gifted
of them; and out-railed the bitterest of
all their decriers of an anti-christian prelacy.
In short, it would have moved your laughter
or your indignation to observe, how submissively
I demeaned myself to these spiritual
fathers; how I hung on their words, echoed
their coarse sayings, and mimicked their beggarly
tones and grimaces.</p>

<p>To complete the farce, I intreated their acceptance
of such returns for their godly instructions,
as fortune had enabled me to make
them. I prevailed with them to give leave
that so unworthy a person might be the instrument
of conveying earthly accommodations
to these dispensers of heavenly treasures; and
it surpasses all belief, with what an avidity they
devoured them! It is true, this last was a serious
consideration: in all other respects, the
whole was a perfect comedy; and of so ridiculous
a cast, that, though my situation gave me
power of face to carry it off gravely then, I
have never reflected on it since without
laughter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>Truly, as you describe it, it was no serious
scene. But what I admire most, is the dexterity
of your genius, and the prodigious progress
you had now made in your favourite arts
of <i>accommodation</i>.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>Necessity is the best master. Besides, can
you blame me for taking more than common
pains to outdo these miscreants in their own
way; I might say, to excel in an art which
surpasses, or at least comprises in it the essence
of all true wisdom? The precept of your admired
<span class="smcap">Antoninus</span>, as you reminded me to-day,
is <small>SIMPLIFY YOURSELF</small><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>. That, I think, was
the quaint expression. It had shewn his reach
and mastery in the trade he professed, much
more, if instead of it, he had preached up,
<small>ACCOMMODATE YOURSELF</small>; the grand secret,
as long experience has taught me, <i>bene beateque
vivendi</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<p>All matters thus prepared, there was now
no hazard in playing my last game. I requested
and obtained leave to make my defence
before the parliament. I had acquired a knack
in speaking; and had drawn on myself more
credit, than fine words deserve, by a scenical
and specious eloquence. If ever I acquitted
myself to my wish, it was on this occasion. I
soothed, I flattered, I alarmed: every topic of
art which my youth had learned, every subject
of address which experience had suggested,
every trick and artifice of popular adulation,
was exhausted. All men were prepared by the
practices of my saintly emissaries to hear me
with favour; and, which is the first and last
advantage of a speaker, to believe me seriously
and conscientiously affected.</p>

<p>In the end I triumphed; and for a moderate
fine obtained leave to shelter myself from the
following storm, which almost desolated this
unhappy country, by retiring into an exile, at
that time more desirable than any employment
of those I left behind me.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>You retired, I think, to <i>France</i>, whither,
no doubt, you carried with you all those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
generous thoughts and consolatory reflexions,
which refresh the spirit of a good man under a
consciousness of suffering virtue.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>Why not, if <i>prudence</i> be a virtue? for what,
but certain prudential regards (which in common
language and common sense are quite
another thing from vicious compliances) have
hitherto, as you have seen, appeared in my
conduct? But be they what they will, they
had a very natural effect, and one which will
always attend on so reasonable a way of proceeding.
For, since you press me so much, I
shall take leave to suggest an observation to
you, more obvious as well as more candid than
any you seem inclined to make on the circumstances
of this long relation. It is, “that the
<i>pretended</i> penitence for my past life, and the
readiness I shewed to acquiesce in the <i>false</i>
accounts which the parliament gave of my plot,
saved my life, and procured my liberty; whilst
the <i>real and true</i> discoveries I made to gain
credit to <i>both</i>, hurt my reputation.” But such
a reflexion might have shocked your system
too much. For it shews that all the benefit,
I drew to myself in this affair, arose from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
those <i>prudential maxims</i> you condemn; and
that all the injury, I suffered, was owing to
the <i>sincerity</i> I still mixed with them.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>Seriously, Sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>I can guess what you would say: but you
promised to hear me out, without interruption.</p>

<p>What remains I shall dispatch in few words,
having so fully vindicated the most obnoxious
part of my life, and opened the general principles,
I acted upon, so clearly.</p>

<p>I went, as you said, to <i>France</i>; where, instead
of the churlish humour of a malcontent,
or the unmanly dejection of a disgraced exile,
I appeared with an ease and gaiety of mind,
which made me welcome to the greatest men
of that country. The ruling principle of my
philosophy was, to make the best of every situation.
And, as my fortune enabled me to
do it, I lived with hospitality, and even splendour;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
and indulged myself in all the delights
of an enlarged and elegant conversation.</p>

<p>Such were my amusements for some years;
during which time, however, I preserved the
notions of loyalty, which had occasioned my disgrace,
and waited some happier turn of affairs,
that might restore me with honour to my country.
But when all hopes of this sort were at
an end, and the government, after the various
revolutions which are well known, seemed fixed
and established in the person of one man, it
was not allegiance, but obstinacy, to hold out
any longer. I easily succeeded in my application
to be recalled, and was even admitted to a
share in the confidence of the <span class="smcap">Protector</span>.
This great man was not without a sensibility
of true glory; and, for that reason, was even
ambitious of the honour, which wit and genius
are ever ready to confer on illustrious
greatness. Every muse of that time distinguished,
and was distinguished by, him. Mine
had improved her voice and accent in a foreign
country: and what nobler occasion to try her happiest
strain than this, of immortalizing a Hero?</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Illustrious acts high raptures do infuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ev’ry conqueror creates a muse;”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
as I then said in a panegyric, which my gratitude
prompted me to present to him<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>This panegyric, presented in verse, could
hardly, I suppose, be suspected of flattery!</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>I expected this; but the occasion, as I said,
might have suggested a fairer interpretation.
And why impute as a fault to me, what the reverend
<span class="smcap">Sprat</span>, as well as <span class="smcap">Dryden</span>, did not disdain
to countenance by their examples? Besides,
as an argument of the unsullied purity
of intention, you might remember, methinks,
that I asked no recompence, and accepted
none, for the willing honours my muse
paid him.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>It must be a sordid muse indeed, that submits
to a venal prostitution. And, to do your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
profession justice, it is not so much avarice, or
even ambition, as a certain gentler passion, the
vanity, shall I call it? of being well with the
<i>great</i>, that is fatal to you poets.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>I can allow for the satire of this reproof, in
a man of ancient and bookish manners. But,
to shew my disinterestedness still more, you
may recollect, if you please, that I embalmed
his memory, when neither his favour nor his
smile were to be apprehended.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>In the short reign of his son.&mdash;But what
then? you made amends for all, by the congratulation
on the happy return of his present
majesty. You know who it was that somebody
complimented in these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“He best can turn, enforce and soften things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To praise great conquerors, and flatter kings.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>Was it for me to stem the torrent of a nation’s
joys by a froward and unseasonable silence?
Did not <span class="smcap">Horace</span>, who fought at <i>Philippi</i>,
do as much for <span class="smcap">Augustus</span>? And should
I, who had suffered for his cause, not embrace
the goodness, and salute the returning
fortunes, of so gracious, so accomplished a
master? His majesty himself, as I truly say of
him, in the poem you object to me,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">“with wisdom fraught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not such as books, but such as practice, taught,”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>did me the justice to understand my address
after another manner. He, who had so often
been forced by the necessities of his affairs to
make compliances with the time, never resented
it from me, a private man and a poet,
that I had made some sacrifices of a like nature.
All this might convince you of the great
truth I meant to inculcate by this long recital,
that not a sullen and inflexible <i>Sincerity</i>, but
a fair and seasonable <i>accommodation of one’s
self</i>, to the various exigencies of the times, is
the golden virtue that ought to predominate in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
a man of life and business. All the rest, believe
me, is the very cant of philosophy and
unexperienced wisdom.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>Wisdom&mdash;and must the sanctity of that
name&mdash;</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>Hear me, Sir&mdash;no exclamations against the
evidence of plain fact. I have a right to expect
another conduct from him, who is grown grey
in the studies of moral science.</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>You learned another lesson in the school of
<span class="smcap">Falkland</span>, <span class="smcap">Hyde</span>, and <span class="smcap">Chillingworth</span>.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>Yes, one I was obliged to unlearn. But,
since you remind me of that school, what was
the effect of adhering pertinaciously to its false
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
maxims? To what purpose were the lives of
<i>two</i> of them prodigally thrown away; and the honour,
the wisdom, the talents of the <i>other</i>, still
left to languish in banishment<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> and obscurity?</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>O! prophane not the glories of immortal,
though successless virtue, with such reproaches.&mdash;Those
adored names shall preach honour to
future ages, and enthrone the majesty of virtue
in the hearts of men, when wit and parts, and
eloquence and poetry, have not a leaf of all
their withered bays to recommend them.</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>Raptures and chimeras!&mdash;&mdash;Rather judge of
the sentiments of future ages, from the present.
Where is the man, (I speak it without boasting,)
that enjoys a fairer fame; who is better
received in all places; who is more listened to
in all companies; who reaps the fruits of a
reasonable and practicable virtue in every return
of honour, more unquestionably, than he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
whose life and principles your outrageous virtue
leads you to undervalue so unworthily? And
take it from me as an oracle, which long age
and experience enable me to deliver with all assurance,
“Whoever, in succeeding times, shall
form himself on the plan here given shall meet
with the safety, credit, applause, and, if he
chuses, honour and fortune in the world, which
may be promised indeed, but never will be
obtained, by any other method.”</p>

<h4>DR. MORE.</h4>

<p>You have spoken. But hear me now, I
conjure you, whilst a poor despised philosopher&mdash;</p>

<h4>MR. WALLER.</h4>

<p>O! I have marked the emotion this discourse
of mine hath awakened in you. I have seen
your impatience: I have watched your eyes
when they sparkled defiance and contradiction
to my argument. But your warmth makes
you forget yourself. I gave a patient hearing
to all your eloquence could suggest in this
cause. I even favoured your zeal, and helped
to blow up your enthusiasm. The rest fell to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
my turn; and besides, the evening, as you see,
shuts in upon us. Let us escape, at least,
from its dews, which, in this decline of the
year, they say, are not the most wholesome,
into a warm apartment within doors; and then
I shall not be averse, especially when you have
taken a few minutes to recollect yourself, to
debate with you what further remains upon
this argument<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>.

<h3>MR. ABRAHAM COWLEY&mdash;THE
REV. MR. SPRAT.</h3>

<h4>TO THE EARL OF ST. ALBANS<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>.</h4>

<p><small>MY LORD</small>,</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> duty I owe your <span class="smcap">Lordship</span>, as well as
my friendship for Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowley</span>, determined
me to lose no time in executing the commission
you was pleased to charge me with by Mr.
D***. I went early the next morning to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
<i>Barn Elms</i><a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>; intending to pass the whole day
with him, and to try if what I might be able
to suggest on the occasion, together with the
weight of your lordship’s advice, could not divert
him from his strange project of <i>Retirement</i>.
Your lordship, no doubt, as all his
other friends, had observed his bias that way
to be very strong; but who, that knew his
great sense, could have thought of it its carrying
him to so extravagant a resolution? For my
own part, I suspected it so little, that, though he
would often talk of retiring, and especially since
your lordship’s favour to him<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>, I considered it
only as the usual language of poets, which they
take up one after another, and love to indulge
in, as what they suppose becomes their family
and profession. It could never come into my
thoughts, that one, who knew the world so
well as Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowley</span>, and had lived so long in
it, who had so fair hopes and so noble a patron,
could seriously think of quitting the
scene at his years, and all for so fantastic a
purpose as that of growing old in the corner of
a country village.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>These, my lord, were my sentiments, when
your friendly message alarmed me with the
apprehension of there being more in the matter
than I had suspected. Yet still I considered it
only as a hasty thought, which a fit of the
spleen, or of the muse it may be, had raised;
and which the free remonstrance of a friend
would easily disperse, or prevent at least from
coming to any fixed and settled resolution. But
how shall I express to your lordship the surprise
I was in, to find that this resolution was
not only taken, but rooted so deeply in him,
that no arguments, nor even your lordship’s
authority, could shake it? I have ever admired
Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowley</span>, as a man of the happiest
temper and truest judgment; but, to say the
least, there was something so particular, I had
almost said perverse, in what he had to allege
for himself on this occasion, that I cannot think
I acquit myself to your lordship, without laying
before you the whole of this extraordinary conversation;
and, as far as my recollection will
serve, in the very words in which it passed
betwixt us.</p>

<p>I went, as I told your lordship, pretty early
to <i>Barn Elms</i>; but my friend had gotten the
start of me by some hours. He was busying
himself with some improvements of his garden,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
and the fields that lie about his house. The
whole circuit of his domain was not so large,
but that I presently came up with him. “My
dear friend,” said he, embracing me, but with
a look of some reserve and disgust, “and is it
you then I have the happiness to see, at length,
in my new settlement? Though I fled hither
from the rest of the world, I had no design to
get out of the reach of my friends. And, to
be plain with you, I took it a little amiss from
one whose entire affection I had reckoned upon,
that he should leave me to myself for these
two whole months, without discovering an inclination,
either from friendship or curiosity, to
know how this retirement agreed with me.
What could induce my best friend to use me so
unkindly?”</p>

<p>Surely, said I, you forget the suddenness of
your flight, and the secresy with which the resolution
was taken. We supposed you gone
only for a few days, to see to the management
of your affairs; and could not dream of your
<i>rusticating</i> thus long, at a time when the town
and court are so busy; when the occasions of
your friends and your own interests seemed to
require your speedy return to us. However,
continued I, it doth not displease me to find
you so dissatisfied with this solitude. It looks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
as if the short experience, you have had of this
recluse life, did not recommend it to you in the
manner you expected. Retirement is a fine
thing in imagination, and is apt to possess you
poets with strange visions. But the charm is
rarely lasting; and a short trial, I find, hath
served to correct these fancies. You feel yourself
born for society and the world, and, by
your kind complaints of your friend, confess
how unnatural it is to deny yourself the proper
delights of a man, the delights of conversation.</p>

<p>Not so fast, interrupted he, if you please, in
your conclusions about the nature of retirement.
I never meant to give up my right in
the affections of those few I call my friends.
But what has this to do with the general purpose
of retreating from the anxieties of business,
the intrigues of policy, or the impertinencies
of conversation? I have lived but too long in
a ceaseless round of these follies. The best
part of my time hath been spent <i>sub dio</i>. I
have served in all weathers, and in all climates,
but chiefly in the torrid zone of politics,
where the passions of all men are on fire,
and where such as have lived the longest, and
are thought the happiest, are scarcely able to
reconcile themselves to the sultry air of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
place. But this warfare is now happily at an
end. I have languished these many years for
the shade. Thanks to my Lord <span class="smcap">St. Albans</span>,
and another noble lord you know of, I have
now gained it. And it is not a small matter, I
assure you, shall force me out of this shelter.</p>

<p>Nothing is easier, said I, than for you men
of wit to throw a ridicule upon any thing. It
is but applying a quaint figure, or a well-turned
sentence, and the business is done. But indeed,
my best friend, it gives me pain to find
you not so much diverting as deceiving yourself
with this unseasonable ingenuity. So long as
these sallies of fancy were employed only to
enliven conversation, or furnish matter for an
ode or an epigram, all was very well. But now
that you seem disposed to <i>act</i> upon them, you
must excuse me if I take the matter a little
more seriously. To deal plainly with you, I
come to tell you my whole mind on this subject:
and, to give what I have to say the greater
consequence with you, I must not conceal from
you, that I come commissioned by the excellent
lord you honour so much, and have just now
mentioned, to expostulate in the freest manner
with you upon it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>We had continued walking all this time, and
were now ascending a sort of natural terras. It
led to a small thicket, in the entrance of which
was a seat that commanded a pleasant view of
the country and the river. Taking me up to it,
“Well,” said he, “my good friend, since your
purpose in coming hither is so kind, and my
Lord <span class="smcap">St. Albans</span> himself doth me the honour
to think my private concerns deserving his particular
notice, it becomes me to receive your
message with respect, and to debate the matter,
since you press it so home upon me, with all
possible calmness. But let us, if you please,
sit down here. You will find it the most agreeable
spot I have to treat you with; and the shade
we have about us will not, I suppose, at this
hour, be unwelcome.”</p>

<p>And now, turning himself to me, “Let me
hear from you, what there is in my retreat to
this place, which a wise man can have reason
to censure, or which may deserve the disallowance
of a friend. I know you come prepared
with every argument which men of the world
have at any time employed against retirement;
and I know your ability to give to each its full
force. But look upon this scene before you,
and tell me what inducements I can possibly
have to quit it for any thing you can promise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
me in exchange? Is there in that vast labyrinth,
you call the world, where so many thousands
lose themselves in endless wanderings and
perplexities, any corner where the mind can
recollect itself so perfectly, where it can attend
to its own business, and pursue its proper interests
so conveniently, as in this quiet and sequestered
spot? Here the passions subside;
or, if they continue to agitate, do not however
transport the mind with those feverish and
vexatious fervours, which distract us in public
life. This is the seat of virtue and of reason;
here I can fashion my life by the precepts of
duty and conscience; and here I have leisure
to make acquaintance, that acquaintance which
elsewhere is so rarely made, with the ways and
works of God.</p>

<p>Think again, my friend. Doth not the
genius of the place seize you? Do you not
perceive a certain serenity steal in upon you?
Doth not the aspect of things around you, the
very stillness of this retreat, infuse a content
and satisfaction which the world knows nothing
of? Tell me, in a word, is there not something
like enchantment about us? Do you not find
your desires more composed, your purposes
more pure, your thoughts more elevated, and
more active, since your entrance into this
scene?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>He was proceeding in this strain, with an
air of perfect enthusiasm, when I broke in upon
him with asking, “Whether this was what he
called <i>debating the matter calmly with me</i>.
Surely,” said I, “this is poetry, or something
still more extravagant. You cannot think I
come prepared to encounter you in this way.
I own myself no match for you at these weapons:
which indeed are too fine for my handling,
and very unsuitable to my purpose if they
were not. The point is not which of us can
say the handsomest things, but the truest, on
either side of the question. It is, as you said,
plain argument, and not rhetorical flourishes,
much less poetical raptures, that must decide
the matter in debate. Not but a great deal
might be said on my side, and, it may be, with
more colour of truth, had I the command of an
eloquence proper to set it off.</p>

<p>I might ask, in my turn, “Where is
mighty charm that draws you to this inglorious
solitude, from the duties of business and conversation,
from the proper end and employment
of man? How comes it to pass, that this
stillness of a country landscape, this uninstructing,
though agreeable enough, scene of fields
and waters, should have greater beauty in your
eye, than <i>flourishing peopled towns</i>, the scenes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
of industry and art, of public wealth and
happiness? Is not the <i>sublime countenance</i> of
man, so one of your acquaintance terms it, a
more delightful object than any of these humble
beauties that lie before us? And are not the
human virtues, with all their train of lovely
and beneficial effects in society, better worth
contemplating, than the products of inanimate
nature in the field or wood? Where should
we seek for <span class="smcap">Reason</span>, but in the minds of men
tried and polished in the school of civil conversation?
And where hath <span class="smcap">Virtue</span> so much as
a being out of the offices of social life? Look
well into yourself, I might say: hath not indeed
the proper genius of solitude affected you!
Doth not I know not what of chagrin and discontent
hang about you? Is there not a gloom
upon your mind, which darkens your views of
human nature, and damps those chearful thoughts
and sprightly purposes, which friendship and
society inspire?”</p>

<p>You see, Sir, were I but disposed, and as
able as you are, to pursue this way of fancy
and declamation, I might conjure up as many
frightful forms in these retired walks, as you
have delightful ones. And the enchantment in
good hands would, I am persuaded, have more
the appearance of reality. But this is not the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
way in which I take upon myself to contend
with you. I would hear, if you please, what
reasons, that deserve to be so called, could determine
you to so strange, and, forgive me if at
present I am forced to think it, so unreasonable
a project, as that of devoting your health and
years to this monastic retirement. I would lay
before you the arguments, which, I presume,
should move you to quit a hasty, perhaps an
unweighted, resolution: so improper in itself,
so alarming to all your friends, so injurious to
your own interest, and, permit me to say, to
the public. I would enforce all this with the
mild persuasions of a friend; and with the wisdom,
the authority of a great person, to whose
opinion you owe a deference, and who deserves
it too from the entire love and affection he bears
you.”</p>

<p>My dearest friend, replied he, with an earnestness
that awed, and a goodness that melted
me, I am not to learn the affection which either
you or my noble friend bear me. I have had
too many proofs of it from both, to suffer me
to doubt it. But why will you not allow me
to judge of what is proper to constitute my
own happiness? And why must I be denied
the privilege of choosing for myself, in a matter
where the different taste or humour of others
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
makes them so unfit to prescribe to me? Yet
I submit to these unequal terms; and if I cannot
justify the choice I have made, even in the
way of serious reason and argument, I promise
to yield myself to your advice and authority.
You have taken me perhaps a little unprepared
and unfurnished for this conflict. I have not
marshalled my forces in form, as you seem to
have done; and it may be difficult, on the
sudden, to methodize my thoughts in the manner
you may possibly expect from me. But
come, said he, I will do my best in this emergency.
You will excuse the rapture which
hurried me at setting out, beyond the bounds
which your severer temper requires. The subject
always fires me; and I find it difficult, in
entering on this argument, to restrain those
triumphant sallies, which had better have been
reserved for the close of it.</p>

<p>Here he paused a little; and recollecting
himself, “But first,” resumed he, “you will
take notice, that I am not at all concerned in
the general question, so much, and, I think,
so vainly agitated, ”<i>whether a life of retirement
be preferable to one of action?</i>” I am
not, I assure you, for unpeopling our cities,
and sending their industrious and useful inhabitants
into woods and cloisters. I acknowledge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
and admire the improvements of arts, the
conveniencies of society, the policies of government<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>.
I have no thought so mad or so
silly, as that of wishing to see the tribes of
mankind disbanded, their interests and connexions
dissolved, and themselves turned loose
into a single and solitary existence. I would
not even wish to see our courts deserted of their
homagers, though I cannot but be of opinion,
that an airing now and then at their country
houses, and that not with the view of diverting,
but recollecting themselves, would prove as useful
to their sense and virtue, as to their estates.
But all this, as I said, is so far from coming
into the scheme of my serious wishes, that it
does not so much as enter into my thoughts.
Let wealth, and power, and pleasure, be as
eagerly sought after, as they ever will be: let
thousands or millions assemble in vast towns,
for the sake of pursuing their several ends, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
it may chance, of profit, vanity, or amusement:
All this is nothing to me, who pretend
not to determine for other men, but to vindicate
my own choice of this retirement.</p>

<p>As much as I have been involved in the engagements
of business, I have not lived thus
long without looking frequently, and sometimes
attentively into myself. I maintain, then,
that to a person so moulded as I am; of the
<i>temper and turn of mind</i>, which Nature hath
given me; of <i>the sort of talents</i>, with which
education or genius hath furnished me; and,
lastly, of the <i>circumstances</i>, in which fortune
hath placed me; I say, to a person so charactered
and so situated, <small>RETIREMENT</small> is not only
his choice, but his duty; is not only what his
inclination leads him to, but his judgement.
And upon these grounds, if you will, I venture
to undertake my own apology to you.”</p>

<p>Your proposal, said I, is fair, and I can have
no objection to close with you upon these terms;
only you must take care, my friend, that you
do not mistake or misrepresent your own talents
or character; a miscarriage, which, allow
me to say, is not very rare from the partialities
which an indulged humour, too easily taken for
nature, is apt to create in us.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>Or what, replied he, if this humour, as you
call it, be so rooted as to become a <i>second</i> nature?
Can it, in the instance before us, be
worth the pains of correcting?</p>

<p>I should think so, returned I, in your case.
But let me first hear the judgement you form of
yourself, before I trouble you with that which
I and your other friends make of you.</p>

<p>I cannot but think, resumed he, that my
situation at present must appear very ridiculous.
I am forced into an <i>apology</i> for my own conduct,
in a very nice affair, which it might
become another, rather than myself, to make
for me. In order to this, I am constrained to
reveal to you the very secrets, that is, the foibles
and weaknesses, of my own heart. I am to lay
myself open and naked before you. This would
be an unwelcome task to most men. But your
friendship, and the confidence I have in your
affection, prevail over all scruples. Hitherto
your friend hath used the common privilege of
wearing a disguise, of masking himself, as the
poet makes his hero, in a <i>cloud</i>, which is of
use to keep off the too near and curious inspection
both of friends and enemies. But, at
your bidding, it falls off, and you are now to see
him in his just proportion and true features.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>My best friend, proceeded he with an air of
earnestness and recollection, it is now above
forty years that I have lived in this world: and
in all the rational part of that time there hath
not, I believe, a single day passed without an
ardent longing for such a retreat from it, as you
see me at length blessed with. You have heard
me repeat some verses, which were made by
me so early as the age of <i>thirteen</i>, and in which
that inclination is expressed as strongly, as in
any thing I have ever said or written on that
subject<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>. Hence you may guess the proper
turn and bias of my nature; which began so
soon, and hath continued thus long, to shew itself
in the constant workings of that passion.</p>

<p>Even in my earliest years at school, you will
hardly imagine how uneasy constraint of every
kind was to me, and with what delight I broke
away from the customary sports and pastimes
of that age, to saunter the time away by myself,
or with a companion, if I could meet with
any such, of my own humour. The same inclination
pursued me to college; where a private
walk, with a book or friend, was beyond
any amusement, which, in that sprightly season
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
of life, I had any acquaintance with. It is
with a fond indulgence my memory even now
returns to these past pleasures. It was in those
retired ramblings that a thousand charming
perceptions and bright ideas would stream in
upon me. The Muse was kindest in those
hours: and, I know not how, Philosophy herself
would <i>oftner</i> meet me amidst the willows of
the <span class="smcap">Cam</span>, than in the formal schools of science,
within the walls of my college, or in my tutor’s
chamber.</p>

<p>I understand, said I, the true secret of that
matter. You had now contracted an intimacy
with the poets, and others of the fanciful tribe.
You was even admitted of their company; and
it was but fit you should adopt their sentiments,
and speak their language. Hence those day-dreams
of <i>shade and silence</i>, and I know not
what visions, which transport the minds of
young men, on their entrance into these regions
of <i>Parnassus</i>.</p>

<p>It should seem then, returned he, by your
way of expressing it, as if you thought this
passion for <i>shade and silence</i> was only pretended
to on a principle of <i>fashion</i>; or, at most,
was catched by the lovers of poetry from each
other, in the way of <i>sympathy</i>, without nature’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
having any hand at all in the production
of it.</p>

<p>Something like that, I told him, was my
real sentiment: and that these agreeable reveries
of the old poets had done much hurt by
being taken too seriously. Were <span class="smcap">Horace</span> and
<span class="smcap">Virgil</span>, think you, as much in earnest as you
appear to be, when they were crying out perpetually
on their favourite theme of <i>otium</i>
and <i>secessus</i>, “they, who lived and died in a
court?”</p>

<p>I believe, said he, they were, and that the
short accounts we have of their lives shew it,
though a perfect dismission from the court was
what they could not obtain, or had not the resolution
to insist upon. But pray, upon your
principles, that all this is but the enchantment
of <i>example</i> or <i>fashion</i>, how came it to pass,
that the first seducers of the family, the old
poets themselves, had fallen into these notions?
They were surely no pretenders. They could
only write from the heart. And methinks it
were more candid, as well as more reasonable,
to account for this passion, which hath so constantly
shewn itself in their successors, from
the same reason. It is likely indeed, and so
much I can readily allow, that the early reading
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
of the poets might contribute something to confirm
and strengthen my natural bias<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>.</p>

<p>But let the matter rest for the present. I
would now go on with the detail of my own
life and experience, so proper, as I think, to
convince you that what I am pleading for is the
result of nature.</p>

<p>I was saying how agreeably my youth passed
in these reveries, if you will have it so, and
especially <i>inter sylvas academi</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dura sed emovere loco me tempora grato,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Civilisque rudem belli tulit &aelig;stus in arma.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>You know the consequence. This civil turmoil
drove me from the shelter of retirement into the
heat and bustle of life; from those studies
which, as you say, had enchanted my youth,
into business and action of all sorts. I lived
in the world: I conversed familiarly with the
great. A change like this, one would suppose,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
were enough to undo the prejudices of education.
But the very reverse happened. The
further I engaged, and the longer I continued
in this scene, the greater my impatience was of
retiring from it.</p>

<p>But you will say, my old vice was nourished
in me by living in the neighbourhood of books
and letters<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>. I was yet in the fairy land of the
Muses; and, under these circumstances, it
was no wonder that neither arms nor business,
nor a court, could prevent the mind from returning
to its old bias. All this may be true.
And yet, I think, if that court had contained
many such persons as some I knew in it, neither
the distractions of business on the one hand,
nor the blandishments of the Muse on the other,
could have disposed me to leave it. But there
were few <span class="smcap">Lord Falklands</span>&mdash;and unhappily
my admiration of that nobleman’s worth and
honour<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> created an invincible aversion to the
rest, who had little resemblance of his virtues.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>I would not be thought, said I, to detract
from so accomplished a character as that of the
Lord <span class="smcap">Falkland</span>; but surely there was something
in his notions of honour&mdash;</p>

<p>Not a word, interrupted he eagerly, that
may but seem to throw a shade on a virtue the
brightest and purest that hath done honour to
these later ages.&mdash;But I turn from a subject
that interests me too much, and would lead me
too far. Whatever attractions there might be
in such a place, and in such <i>friendships</i>, the
iniquity of the times soon forced me from
them. Yet I had the less reason to complain,
as my next removal was into the family of so
beneficent a patron as the Lord <span class="smcap">Jermyn</span>, and
into the court of so accomplished a princess as
the <span class="smcap">Queen Mother</span>.</p>

<p>My residence, you know, was now for many
years in <i>France</i>; a country, which piques itself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
on all the refinements of civility. Here the
world was to appear to me in its fairest form,
and, it was not doubted, would put on all its
charms to wean me from the love of a studious
retired life. I will not say I was disappointed
in this expectation. All that the elegance of
polished manners could contribute to make society
attractive, was to be found in this new
scene. My situation, besides, was such, that
I came to have a sort of familiarity with greatness.
Yet shall I confess my inmost sentiments
of this splendid life to you? I found it empty,
fallacious, and even disgusting. The outside
indeed was fair. But to me, who had an opportunity
of looking it through, nothing could
be more deformed and hateful. All was ambition,
intrigue, and falsehood. Every one intent
on his own schemes, frequently wicked,
always base and selfish. Great professions of
honour, of friendship, and of duty; but all
ending in low views and sordid practices. No
truth, no sincerity: without which, conversation
is but words; and the polish of manners,
the idlest foppery.</p>

<p>Surely, interposed I, this picture must be
overcharged. Frailties and imperfections, no
doubt, there will be in all societies of men,
especially where there is room for competition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
in their pursuits of honour and interest. But
your idea of a court is that of a den of thieves,
only better dressed, and more civilized.</p>

<p>That however, said he, is the idea under
which truth obliges me to represent it. Believe
me, I have been long enough acquainted with
that country, to give you a pretty exact account
of its inhabitants. Their sole business
is to follow the humour of the prince, or of his
favourite, to speak the current language, to
serve the present turn, and to cozen one another.
In short, their virtue is, civility; and
their sense, cunning. You will guess now,
continued he, how uneasy I must be in such
company; I, who cannot lie, though it were
to make a friend, or ruin an enemy; who have
been taught to bear no respect to any but true
wisdom; and, whether it be nature or education,
could never endure (pardon the foolish
boast) that hypocrisy should usurp the honours,
and triumph in the spoils of virtue.</p>

<p>Nay further, my good friend, (for I must
tell you all I know of myself, though it expose
me ever so much to the charge of folly or even
vanity) I was not born for courts and general
conversation. Besides the unconquerable
aversion I have to knaves and fools (though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
these last, but that they are commonly knaves
too, I could bring myself to tolerate); besides
this uncourtly humour, I have another of so
odd a kind, that I almost want words to express
myself intelligibly to you. It is a sort
of capricious delicacy, which occasions a wide
difference in my estimation of those characters,
in which the world makes no distinction. It is
not enough to make me converse with ease and
pleasure with a man, that I see no notorious
vices, or even observe some considerable virtues
in him. His good qualities must have a certain
grace, and even his sense must be of a certain
turn, to give me a relish of his conversation.</p>

<p>I see you smile at this talk, and am aware
how fantastic this squeamishness must appear
to you. But it is with men and manners, as
with the forms and aspects of natural things.
A thousand objects recal ideas, and excite sensations
in my mind, which seem to be not perceived,
or not heeded, by other men. The
look of a country, the very shading of a landskip,
shall have a sensible effect on me, which
they, who have as good eyes, appear to make
no account of. It is just the same with the
characters of men. I conceive a disgust at
some, and a secret regard for others, whom
many, I believe, would estimate just alike.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
And what is worse, a long and general conversation
hath not been able to cure me of this
foible. I question, said he, turning himself to
me, but, if I was called upon to assign the
reasons of that entire affection, which knits me
to my best friend, they would be resolved at
last into a something, which they, who love
him perhaps as well, would have no idea of.</p>

<p>He said this in a way that disarmed me, or I
had it in my mind to have rallied him on his
doctrine of <i>occult qualities</i> and <i>unintelligible</i>
forms. I therefore contented myself with saying,
that I must not hear him go on at this
strange rate; and asked him if it was possible
he could suffer himself to be biassed, in an affair
of this moment, by such whimsies?</p>

<p>Those whimsies, resumed he, had a real
effect. But consider further, the endless impertinencies
of conversation; the dissipation,
and loss of time; the diversion of the mind
from all that is truly useful or instructive, from
what a reasonable man would or should delight
in: add to these, the vexations of business;
the slavery of dependence, the discourtesies of
some, the grosser injuries of others; the danger,
or the scorn, to which virtue is continually
subject; in short, the knavery, or folly, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
malevolence, of all around you; and tell me,
if any thing but the unhappy times, and a sense
of duty, could have detained a man of my temper
and principles so long in a station of life so
very uneasy and disgusting to me.</p>

<p>Nothing is easier, said I, than to exaggerate
the inconveniencies of any situation. The world
and the court have doubtless theirs. But you
seem to forget one particular; that the <i>unhappy
times</i> you speak of, and the state of the court,
were an excuse for part of the disagreeable circumstances
you have mentioned. The face of
things is now altered. The storm is over. A
calm has succeeded. And why should not you
take the benefit of these halcyon days, in which
so many others have found their ease, and even
enjoyment?</p>

<p>These halcyon days, returned he, are not,
alas! what unexperienced men are ready to represent
them. The same vices, the same follies,
prevail still, and are even multiplied and
enflamed by prosperity. A suffering court, if
any, might be expected to be the seedplot of
virtues. But, to satisfy your scruples, I have
even made a trial of these happier times. All
I wished to myself from the happiest, was but
such a return for my past services, as might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
enable me to retire with decency. Such a return
I seem not to have merited. And I care
not at this time of day to waste more of my
precious time in deserving a better treatment.</p>

<p>Your day, said I, is not so far spent, as to
require this hasty determination. Besides, if
this be all, the world may be apt to censure
your retreat, as the effect of chagrin and disappointment.</p>

<p>His colour rose, as I said this. The world,
resumed he, will censure as it sees fit. I must
have leave at length to judge for myself in what
so essentially concerns my own happiness.
Though if ever <i>chagrin</i> may be pleaded as a
reason for retirement, perhaps nobody had ever
a better right than I have to plead it. You
know what hath happened of late, to give me
a disgust to courts. You know the view I had
in my late comedy<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and the grounds I had to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
expect that it would not be ill taken. But you
know too the issue of that attempt. And should
I, after this experience of courtly gratitude, go
about to solicit their favours?</p>

<p>But, to let you see that I am swayed by better
motives than those of <i>chagrin</i>, I shall not conceal
from you what I am proud enough to think
of my <small>TALENTS</small>, as well as temper.</p>

<p>There are but two sorts of men, pursued he,
that should think of living in a court, however
it be that we see animals of all sorts, clean and
unclean, enter into it.</p>

<p>The one is of those strong and active spirits
that are formed for business, whose ambition
reconciles them to the bustle of life, and whose
capacity fits them for the discharge of its functions.
These, especially if of noble birth and
good fortunes, are destined to fill the first
offices in a state; and if, peradventure, they
add virtue to their other parts and qualities, are
the blessings of the age they live in. Some
few such there have been in former times; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
the present, it may be, is not wholly without
them.</p>

<p>The <small>OTHER</small> sort, are what one may properly
enough call, if the phrase were not somewhat
uncourtly, the <small>MOB OF COURTS</small>; they, who
have vanity or avarice without ambition, or ambition
without talents. These, by assiduity,
good luck, and the help of their vices (for they
would scorn to earn advancement, if it were to
be had, by any worthy practices), may in time
succeed to the lower posts in a government;
and together make up that showey, servile,
selfish crowd, we dignify with the name of
<small>COURT</small>.</p>

<p>Now, though I think too justly of myself to
believe I am qualified to enter into the <i>former</i>
of these lists, you may conclude, if you please,
that I am too proud to brigue for an admission
into the <i>latter</i>. I pretend not to great abilities
of any kind; but let me presume a little in supposing,
that I may have some too good to be
thrown away on such company.</p>

<p>Here, my lord, the unusual freedom, and
even indecency, of Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowley’s</span> invective
against courts, transported me so far, that I
could not forbear turning upon him with some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
warmth. Surely, said I, my friend is much
changed from what I always conceived of him.
This heat of language, from one of your candour,
surprises me equally with the injustice
of it. It is so far from <i>calm reasoning</i>, that it
wants but little, methinks, of downright railing.
I believe, continued I, that I think more
highly, that is, more justly, of Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowley</span>
in every respect, than he allows himself to do.
Yet I see not that either his time, or his talents,
would be misemployed in the services he
so much undervalues. Permit me to say, your
resentment hath carried you too far; and that
you do not enough consider the friends you left
at court, or the noble lord that wishes your return
thither.</p>

<p>I do, said he hastily, consider both. But,
with your leave, since I am forced to defend
myself against an ignominious charge, I must
do myself the right to assume what I think
belongs to me. I repeat it; I have long thought
my time lost in the poor amusements and vanities
of the great world, and have felt an impatience
to get into a quiet scene, where, slender
as my talents are, I might employ them to
better purpose.</p>

<p>And think not, proceeded he, that I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
carried to this choice by any thing so frivolous
as the idleness of a poetical fancy. Not but the
Muse, which hath been the darling of my
youth, may deserve to be the companion of my
riper age. For I am far from renouncing an
art, which, unprofitable as it hath ever been to
me, is always entertaining: and when employed,
as I mean it shall be, in other services
than those by which a voluptuous court seems
willing to disgrace it, I see not what there is
in this amusement of poetry, for the severest
censor of life and manners to take offence at.
Yet still I intend it for an amusement. My
serious occupations will be very different; such
as you, my friend, cannot disapprove, and should
encourage. But I have opened to you my intentions
more than once, and need not give
you the trouble at this time to hear me explain
them.</p>

<p>You mean, interposed I, to apply yourself
to <i>natural</i> and <i>religious</i> inquiries. Your design
is commendable; and I would not dissuade
you from it. But what should hinder your
pursuing this design as well in society as in this
solitude?</p>

<p>What, at <small>COURT</small>, returned he, where the
only object, that all men are in quest of, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
<small>GAIN</small>; and the only deity they acknowledge,
<small>FORTUNE</small>? Or say that such idolatries did not
prevail, there, how shall the mind be calm
enough for so sublime inquiries? or where, but
in this scene of genuine nature, is there an opportunity
to indulge in them? Here, if any
where, is the observation of the poet verified,
<small>DEUS EST QUODCUNQUE VIDES</small>. Look round,
my friend, on this florid earth, on the various
classes of <i>animals</i> that inhabit, and the countless
<i>vegetable</i> tribes that adorn it. Here is the
proper school of wisdom,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And this our life, exempt from public haunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sermons in stones, and good in every thing<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>Infinite are the uses, continued he, which
would result from this method of applying experiment
and observation to <i>Natural Science</i>.
I have taken occasion, you know, to offer a
slight sketch of them to the Public very lately<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>.
But the principal I would draw from it to myself
should be, to inure the mind to just conceptions
of the divine nature; that so, with the
better advantage, I might turn myself to the
awful study of his <i>Word</i>. And here, my friend,
I am sensible how much I may expect to be
animated by your zeal, and enlightened by
your instruction. In the mean time, I pretend
to possess some qualities, which, if rightly
applied, may not be unsuitable to so high an
undertaking. I feel myself impelled by an
eager curiosity: I have much patience, and
some skill in making experiments. I may even
be allowed to boast of a readiness in the learned
languages; and am not without a tincture of
such other studies, as the successful prosecution
of <small>PHYSICS</small>, and still more of <span class="smcap">Divinity</span>,
requires. You may further impute to me, if
you please, an ingenuous love of truth, and an
ordinary degree of judgment to discern it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>These, concluded he, are the <small>TALENTS</small>, of
which I spoke to you so proudly; and with
the help of these (especially if you allow me
<i>one</i> other, the power of <i>communicating</i> what
I may chance to learn of natural or divine
things), I might hope to render a better account
of this solitude, than of any employments
I could reasonably aspire to, in the world
of men and of business.</p>

<p>He said this with an air of solemnity, which
left me a little at a loss what to reply to him,
when he relieved my perplexity by adding,
“but, though there was nothing of all this in
the case, and my zeal for promoting knowledge
in this private way were as lightly to be accounted
of, as <i>that</i>, which led me to propose
the more extensive scheme I before mentioned,
probably will be, yet what should draw me
from this leisure of a learned retirement? For
though I please myself with the prospect of
doing some <i>public</i> service by my studies, yet
need I blush to own, to my learned friend, the
fondness I should still have for them, were they
only to end in my own <i>private</i> enjoyment?
Yes, let me open my whole soul to you. I
have ever delighted in letters, and have even
found them, what the world is well enough
content they should be, their own reward. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
doubt, if this language would be understood in
all companies. And let others speak as they
find. But to me the year would drag heavily,
and life itself be no life, if it were not quickened
by these ingenuous pleasures.”</p>

<p>Indeed, were it only for the very quiet and
indolence of mind, which retirement promises,
why should I be envied this calm in the decline
of a troubled life? But let the Muse speak
for me,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“After long toils and voyages in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This quiet port let my tost vessel gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heav’nly rest this earnest to me lend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my life sleep, and learn to love her end.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And what if they, who have not the means
of enjoying this rest, submit to the drudgery
of business? Is that a reason for me to continue
in it, who have made my fortune, even
to the extent of my wishes? I see you smile at
this boast. But where would you have me
stop in my desires; or what is it you would
have me understand by the mysterious language
of <i>making a fortune</i>? Is it two hundred
a year, or four, or a thousand? Say, where
shall we fix, or what limits will you undertake
to prescribe to the vague and shifting notion of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
a competency? Or, shall we own the truth at
once, that every thing is a <i>competency</i> which
a man is contented to live upon, and that therefore
it varies only, as his desires are more or
less contracted?</p>

<p>To talk at any other rate of a <i>man’s fortune</i>,
is surely to expose one’s self to the ridicule,
which the philosopher, you know, threw on the
restless humour of king Pyrrhus. ’Tis whim,
chimera, madness, or what you will, except
sober reason and common sense. Yet still the
world cries, “What, sit down with a pittance,
when the ways of honour and fortune are open
to you? take up with what may barely satisfy,
when you have so fair a chance for affluence,
and even superfluity?”</p>

<p>Alas! and will that <i>affluence</i>, then, more
than satisfy? or can it be worth the while to
labour, for a <i>superfluity</i>?</p>

<p>’Tis true the violence of the times, in which
it was my fortune to bear a part, had left me
bare and unprovided even of those moderate
accommodations, which my education and
breeding might demand, and which a parent’s
piety had indeed bequeathed to me. It was
but fitting then I should strive to repair this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
loss; and the rather, as my honest services
gave me leave to hope for a speedy reparation.
And thus far I was contented to try my fortune
in the court, though at the expence of much
uneasy attendance and solicitation. But, seeing
that this assiduity was without effect, and
that the bounty of two excellent persons<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> hath
now set me above the necessity of continuing
it, what madness were it to embark again</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Fluctibus in mediis et tempestatibus urbis!”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>So that if you will needs be urging me with
the ceaseless exhortation of</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I, bone, quo virtus tua te vocat: I pede fausto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grandia laturus meritorum pr&aelig;mia:&mdash;”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I must take leave to remind you of the sage
reply that was made to it. It was, you know,
by an old soldier, who found himself exactly
in my situation. The purse, which he had
lost by one accident, he had recovered by another.
The conclusion was, that he had no
mind, in this different state of affairs, to turn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
adventurer again, and expose himself to the
same perilous encounters:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Post h&aelig;c ille catus, quantumvis <small>RUSTICUS</small>, ibit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ibit eo, quo vis <small>QUI ZONAM PERDIDIT</small>, inquit.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In one word, my friend, I am happy here,
as you see me, in my little farm, which yet is
large enough to answer all my real necessities;
and I am not in the humour of him in the
fable<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>, to fill my head with visions, and spend
a wretched life in quest of the <i>flying island</i>.</p>

<p>And now, added he, you have before you in
one view the principal reasons that have determined
me to this retreat. I might have enlarged
on each more copiously; but I know to
whom I speak: and perhaps to such a one I
might even have spared a good deal of what I
have now been offering, from the several considerations
of my <small>TEMPER</small>, <small>TALENTS</small>, and <small>SITUATION</small>.</p>

<p>Here he stopped. And now, my lord, it
came to my turn to take the lead in this controversy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
There was indeed an ample field before
me. And, if the other side of the question
afforded most matter for wit and declamation,
mine had all the advantages of good sense and
sound reason. The superiority was so apparent,
and my victory over him, in point of argument,
so sure, that I thought it needless and
ungenerous to press him on every article of
his defence, in which he had laid himself open
to me.</p>

<p>Your lordship hath, no doubt, observed,
with wonder and with pity, the strange spirit
that runs through every part of it: the confined
way of thinking, which hath crept upon him;
the cynical severity, he indulges against courts;
the importance he would sometimes assume to
his own character; the peevish turn of mind,
that leads him to take offence at the lighter
follies and almost excusable vices of the great;
in short, the resentment, the pique, the chagrin,
which one overlooks in the hopeless
suitor, or hungry poet, but which are very unaccountable
in one of Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowley’s</span> condition
and situation.</p>

<p>Here then, my lord, was a fair occasion for
a willing adversary. But I spared the infirmities
of my friend. I judged it best, too, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
keep him in temper, and avoid that heat of altercation,
which must have arisen from touching
these indiscretions, as they deserved. Your
lordship sees the reason I had for confining my
reply to such parts of his apology, as bore the
fairest shew of argument, and might be encountered
without offence.</p>

<p>When he had ended, therefore, with so
formal a recapitulation of his discourse, I
thought it not amiss to follow him in his own
train; and, dissembling the just exceptions I
had to his vindication in other respects, “You
have proceeded, said I, in a very distinct method,
and have said as much, I believe, on the
subject, as so bad a cause would admit. But
if this indeed be all you have to allege, for so
uncommon a fancy, you must not think it
strange, if I pronounce it, without scruple,
very insufficient for your purpose.</p>

<p>For, to give your several pleas a distinct examination,
what is that <small>TEMPER</small>, let me ask,
on which you insist so much, but a wayward
humour, which your true judgement should
correct and controul by the higher and more
important regards of <i>duty</i>? Every man is born
with some prevailing propensity or other,
which, if left to itself, and indulged beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
certain bounds, would grow to be very injurious
to himself and society. There is something,
no doubt, amusing in the notion of <i>retirement</i>.
The very word implies ease and
quiet, and self-enjoyment. And who doubts,
that in the throng and bustle of life, most men
are fond to image to themselves, and even to
wish for a scene of more composure and tranquillity?
It is just as natural as that the labourer
should long for his repose at night; or
that the soldier, amidst the dust and heat of a
summer’s march, should wish for the conveniencies
of shade and shelter. But what wild
work would it make if these so natural desires
should be immediately gratified? if the labourer
should quit his plow, and the soldier his arms,
to throw themselves into the first shade or
thicket that offered refreshment? All you have
therefore said on this article can really stand
for nothing in the eye of sober reason, whatever
figure it may make in the dress of your
eloquence<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>. The inconveniencies of every station
are to be endured from the obligations of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
duty, and on account of the services one is
bound to render to himself and his country.</p>

<p>True, replied he, if it appeared to be one’s
duty, or even interest, to continue in that station.
But what principle of conscience binds
me to a slavish dependence at court? or what
interest, public or private, can be an equivalent
for wearing these chains, when I have it
in my power to throw them off, and redeem
myself into a state of liberty?</p>

<p>What <i>Interest</i>, do you ask? returned I.
Why that great and extensive one, which <i>society</i>
hath in an honest and capable man’s continuing
to bear a part in public affairs. For as
to inducements of another kind, I may find
occasion hereafter to press them upon you more
seasonably. Consider well with yourself, what
would the consequence be, if all men of honour
and ability were to act upon your principles?
What a world would this be, if knaves and
fools only had the management in their hands,
and all the virtuous and wise, as it were by
common consent, were to withdraw from it?
Nay, the issue would even be fatal to themselves;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
and they would presently find it impossible
to taste repose, even in their own sanctuary
of retirement.</p>

<p>Small need, replied he, to terrify one’s self
with such apprehensions. The virtuous, at
least they who pass for such, will generally
have ambition enough to keep them in the road
of public employments. So long as there are
such things as riches and honours, courts will
never be unfurnished of suitors, even from
among the tribes of lettered and virtuous men.
The desperately bad, at least, will never have
the field left entirely to themselves. And, after
all, the interest of men in office is, in the
main, so providentially connected with some
regard to the rules of honour and conscience,
that there is seldom any danger that matters
should come to extremities under the <i>worst</i>
administration. And I doubt this is all we are
to expect, or at least to reckon upon with assurance,
under the very <i>best</i>.</p>

<p>But my answer is more direct. It is not for
your little friend to think of getting a seat in
the cabinet-council, or of conducting the great
affairs of the state. He knows himself to be as
unfit for those high trusts, as he is incapable of
aspiring to them. Besides, he does not allow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
himself to doubt of their being discharged with
perfect ability, by the great persons who now
fill them. <span class="smcap">He</span>, at least, who occupies the
foremost place of authority, is, by the allowance
of all, to be paralleled with any that the
wisest prince hath ever advanced to that station<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>.
And when so consummate a pilot sits
at the helm, it seems a matter of little moment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
by what hands the vessel of the commonwealth
is navigated.</p>

<p>I could not agree with him in this concluding
remark, and much less in the high-flown encomium
which introduced it<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>. But, waving
these lesser matters, I contented myself with
observing, “That let him put what gloss he
would on this humour of declining civil business,
it must needs be considered by all unbiassed
persons, as highly prejudicial to public
order and government; that, if good men would
not be employed, the bad must; and that, to
say the least, the cause of learning and virtue
must suffer exceedingly in the eyes of men,
when they see those very qualities, which alone
can render us useful to the world, dispose us to
fly from it.”</p>

<p>For as to the <i>plea</i>, continued I, of employing
them to better purpose in the way of <i>private
and solitary</i> <small>CONTEMPLATION</small>, I can hold
it for little better than enthusiasm. Several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
persons, I know, would give it a worse name,
and say, as <span class="smcap">Tacitus</span> somewhere does, that it
serves only for a specious cover to that love of
ease and self-indulgence, which he will have
to be at the bottom of such pretences<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>. But
even with the best construction the matter was
capable of, he could never, I insisted, justify
that plea to the understandings of prudent and
knowing men. We allow the obscure pedant
to talk high of the dignity of his office, and
magnify, as much as he pleases, the importance
of his speculations. Such an indulgence serves
to keep him in humour with himself, and may
be a means to convert a low and plodding genius
to the only use of which it is capable.
But for a man of experience in affairs, and who
is qualified to shine in them, to hold this language,
is very extraordinary.</p>

<p>I saw with what impatience he heard me,
and therefore took care to add, “’Tis true,
the studies to which you would devote yourself,
are the noblest in the world of science.
For <i>Divinity</i>, the very name speaks its elogium.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
And the countenance which his majesty
is pleased, in his true wisdom, to give to
<i>natural science</i>, must be thought to ennoble
that branch of learning beyond all others, that
are merely of human consideration. Yet still,
my friend, what need of taking these studies
out of the hands of those, to whom they are
properly intrusted? Religion is very safe in the
bosom of the national church. And questions
of natural science will doubtless be effectually
cleared and ventilated in the <i>New Society</i><a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>,
and in the schools of our <i>Universities</i>. It
could never be his majesty’s intention to thin
his court, for the sake of furnishing students in
natural philosophy.”</p>

<p>And can you then, interposed he, in your
concern for what you very improperly call my
interests, allow yourself to speak so coolly of
the great interests of natural and divine truth?
Is religion a trade to be confined to the craftsmen?
Or, are fellows of colleges and of the
Royal Society, if such we are to have, the only
persons concerned to adore God in the wonders
of his creation? Pardon me, my friend: I
know you mean nothing less; but the strange
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
indifference of your phrase provokes me to this
expostulation.</p>

<p>You warm yourself, resumed I, too hastily.
My design was only to suggest, that as there
are certain orders of men appointed for the sole
purpose of studying divinity, and advancing
philosophy, I did not see that a man of business
was obliged to desert his proper station for
the sake of either.</p>

<p>I suspect, said he, there may be some equivocation
wrapped up in that word <i>obliged</i>. All
I know is, that I shall spend my time more innocently,
at least; and, I presume to think,
more usefully in those studies, than in that
slippery <i>station</i>, if it may deserve to be called
one, of court-favour and dependence. And if
I extended the observation to many others,
that are fond to take up their residence in these
quarters, I cannot believe I should do them
any injustice.</p>

<p>I cannot tell, returned I, against whom this
censure is pointed. But I know there are
many of the gravest characters, and even lights
and fathers of the church, who do not consider
it as inconsistent, either with their duty, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
the usefulness of their profession, to continue
in that station.</p>

<p>O! mistake me not, replied he: I intended
no reflection on any of the clergy, and much
less on the great prelates of the church, for
their attendance in the courts of princes. Theirs
is properly an exempt case. They are the
authorized guides and patterns of life. Their
great abilities indeed qualify them, above all
others, for serving the cause of science and religion,
by their private studies and meditations.
But they very properly consider too, that part
of their duty is to enlighten the ignorant of all
ranks, by their wise and pious discourse, and
to awe and reclaim the wandering of all denominations,
by their example. Hence it is, that
I cannot enough admire the zeal of so many
pastors of the church; who, though the slavish
manners and libertinism of a court must be
more than ordinarily offensive to men of their
characters, continue to discharge their office so
painfully, and yet so punctually, in that situation.</p>

<p>Here, my lord, observing my friend for once
to deliver himself reasonably, I was encouraged
to add, that since he was so just to maintain
the commerce of good and wise churchmen in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
the great world to be, as it truly was, a matter
of duty, he should also have the candour to own,
that his withdrawing from it was, at least, a
work of <i>Supererogation</i>.</p>

<p>It might be so, he said; but, though our
church gave no encouragement to think we
merit by such works, he did not know that it
condemned and utterly forbad them.</p>

<p>O! but, returned I, if that be all, and you
acknowledge at last that your <i>retiring</i> is no
matter of duty, it will be easy to advance another
step, and demonstrate to you, that such
a project is, in your case, altogether unreasonable<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>.</p>

<p>For, notwithstanding all you have said, in
the spirit and language of stoicism, of the comforts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
of your present <small>SITUATION</small>, will you seriously
undertake to persuade me that they are
in any degree comparable to what you might
propose to yourself, by returning to a life of
business? Is the littleness, the obscurity, and
pardon me if I even say, the meanness of this
retreat, to be put in competition with the liberal
and even splendid provision, which your
friends at court will easily be able to make for
you? Is it nothing, my friend, (for let us talk
common sense, and not bewilder ourselves with
the visions of philosophy) is it nothing to live
in a well-furnished house, to keep a good table,
to command an equipage, to have many friends
and dependants, to be courted by inferiors, to
be well received by the great, and to be somebody
even in the <i>presence</i>?</p>

<p>And what if, in order to compass such things,
some little devoirs and assiduities are expected?
Is it not the general practice? And what every
body submits to, can it be ignominious? Is
this any thing more than conforming one’s self
to the necessary subordination of society? Or,
what if some time passes in these services,
which a present humour suggests might be
more agreeably spent in other amusements?
The recompence cannot be far off; and, in the
mean time, the lustre and very agitation of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
life of business, hath somewhat in it sprightly
and amusing. Besides, yours is not the case
of one that is entering, for the first time, on a
course of expectation. Your business is half
done. The prince is favourable; and there are
of his ministers that respect and honour you.
Your services are well known; your reputation
is fair; your connexions great; and the season
inviting. What, with all these advantages,
forego the court in a moping mood, or, as angry
men use, run to moralize in a cloister!</p>

<p>I was proceeding in the warmth of this remonstrance,
when, with a reproachful smile,
he turned upon me, and, in a kind of rapture,
repeated the following lines of <span class="smcap">Spenser</span>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Full little knowest thou, that hast not tried,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To waste long nights in pensive discontent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speed to-day, to be put back to-morrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feed on hope, to pine with fear and sorrow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have thy prince’s grace, yet want his peeres<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To eat thy heart through comfortless despaires;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To spend, to give, to want, to be undonne.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This, said he, is my answer once for all to your
long string of interrogatories. I learnt it of
one that had much experience in courts: and
I thought it worth imprinting on my memory,
to have it in readiness on such an occasion.
Or, if you would rather have my answer in my
own words, the Muse shall give it you in a little
poem, she dictated very lately<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>. It may shew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
you perhaps, that, though my nature be somewhat
melancholy, I am not <i>moping</i>; and that
I can moralize, and even <i>complain</i>, as I have
reason to do, without being <i>angry</i>.</p>

<p>The look and tone of voice, with which he
said this, a little disconcerted me. But I recovered
myself, and was going on to object to
his unreasonable warmth, and the fascination of
this wicked poetry, when he stopped me with
saying, “Come, no more of these remonstrances
and upbraidings. I have heard enough of your
pleadings in a cause, which no eloquence can
carry against my firm and fixed resolutions. I
have seen, besides, the force you have done to
yourself in this mock combat. Your extreme
friendliness hath even tempted you to act a part
which your true sense, and the very decorum
of your profession, I have observed through all
your disguises, has rendered painful to you.
I will tell you my whole mind in one word.
No inducements of what the world calls <small>INTEREST</small>,
no views of <small>HONOUR</small>, no, nor what
the poet aptly calls, <small>SANCTISSIMA DIVITIARUM
MAJESTAS</small><a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>, shall make me recede from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
purpose I am bent upon, of consecrating the
remainder of a comfortless distracted life, to the
sweets of this obscure retirement. Believe me,
I have weighed it well, with all its inconveniencies.
And I find them such as are nothing
to the agonies have long felt in that troubled
scene, to which you would recal me. If it
hath any ingredients, which I cannot so well
relish, they are such as my friends, and, above
all, such as you, my best friend, may reconcile
to me. Let me but have the pleasure to
see the few, I love and esteem, in these shades,
and I shall not regret their solitude.</p>

<p>And as for my much honoured friend, whose
munificence hath placed me in them, I shall
hope to satisfy him in the most effectual manner.
Nothing, you will believe, could give me
a pain equal to that of being suspected of ingratitude
towards my best benefactor. It was
indeed with the utmost difficulty, that I constrained
myself at last to think of leaving his
service. The truth is, he expostulated with me
upon it pretty roundly; and though my resolution
was taken, I left him with the concern
of not being able to give him entire satisfaction.
These repeated instances by you are a fresh
proof of his goodness, and do me an honour
I had little reason to expect from him. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
his lordship’s notions of life and mine are very
different, as is fitting in persons, whom fortune
hath placed in two such different situations.
It becomes me to bear the most grateful
remembrance of his kind intentions; and, for
the rest, I can assure myself, that his equity
and nobleness of mind, will permit an old
servant to pursue, at length, his own inclinations.</p>

<p>However, to repay his goodness as I can,
and to testify all imaginable respect to his judgment,
I have purposed to write my own
<small>APOLOGY</small> to his lordship; and to represent to
him, in a better manner, than I have done in
this sudden and unpremeditated conversation,
the reasons that have determined me to this resolution.
I have even made some progress in
the design, and have digested into several
<i>essays</i> the substance of such reflections as, at
different times, have had most weight with
me<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>Hearing him speak in so determined a manner,
I was discouraged from pressing him further
with such other considerations, as I had,
prepared on this argument. Only I could not
help enforcing, in the warmest manner, and in
terms your lordship would not allow me to use
in this recital, what he himself had owned of
your unexampled goodness to him; and the
obligation which, I insisted, that must needs
create in a generous mind, of paying an unreserved
obedience to your lordship’s pleasure.
He gave me the hearing very patiently; but
contented himself with repeating his design of
justifying himself to your lordship in the apology
he had before promised.</p>

<p>And now, resumed he with an air of alacrity,
since you know my whole mind, and
that no remonstrances can move me, confess
the whole truth; acknowledge at last that you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
have dissembled with me all this while, and
that, in reality, you approve my resolution. I
know you do, my friend, though you struggle
hard to conceal it. It cannot be otherwise.
Nature, which linked our hearts together, had
formed us in one mould. We have the same
sense of things; the same love of letters and of
virtue. And though I would not solicit one of
your years and your profession to follow me into
the shade, yet I know you so well<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>, that you will
preserve in the world that equal frame of
mind, that indifference to all earthly things,
which I pretend to have carried with me into
this solitude.</p>

<p>Go on, my friend, in this track; and be an
example to the churchmen of our days, that
the highest honours of the gown, which I easily
foresee are destined to your abilities, are not
incompatible with the strictest purity of life,
and the most heroic sentiments of integrity and
honour. Go, and adorn the dignities which
are reserved for you; and remember only in
the heights of prosperity to be what you are,
to serve the world with vigour, yet so as to indulge
with me

</div></div></div>

<p>I began to be a little uneasy at his long sermon,
when he broke it off with this couplet.
The day by this time was pretty far advanced;
and rising from his seat, he proposed to me to
walk into his hermitage (so he called his house);
where, he said, I should see how a philosopher
lived as well as talked. I staid to dine, and
spent a good part of the afternoon with him.
We discoursed of various matters; but not a
word more of what had occasioned this visit.
Only he shewed me the <i>complaining poem</i> he
had mentioned, and of which, for the pleasure
so fine a composition will give you, I here send
your lordship a copy. His spirits, he said,
were enlivened by the face of an old friend;
and indeed I never knew his conversation more
easy and chearful<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>; which yet I could not perfectly
enjoy for the regret the ill success of my
negociation had given me.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>I returned to town in the evening, ruminating
on what had passed, and resolving to
send your lordship an exact account of our
conversation. I particularly made a point of
suppressing nothing which Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowley</span> had
to say for himself in this debate, however it
may sometimes seem to make against me.
The whole hath grown under my pen into a
greater length than I expected. But your
Lordship wished to know the bottom of our
friend’s mind; and I thought you would see
it more distinctly and clearly in this way, than
in any other. I am, my lord, with the most
profound respect,</p>

<span class="medium">ON THE AGE OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.</span></h2>

<h3>MR. DIGBY, DR. ARBUTHNOT,
MR. ADDISON.</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> happened, in the summer of the year
1716, that Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>
had occasion to take a journey together into
<i>Warwickshire</i>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Digby</span>, who had received
intelligence of their motions, and was then at
<i>Coleshill</i>, contrived to give them the meeting
at <i>Warwick</i>; where they intended to pass a
day or two, in visiting the curiosities of that
fine town, and the more remarkable of these
remains of antiquity that are to be seen in its
neighbourhood. These were matter of high
entertainment to all of them; to Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
for the pleasure of recollecting the ancient
times; to Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, on account of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
some political reflexions, he was fond of indulging
on such occasions; and to Mr. <span class="smcap">Digby</span>,
from an ingenuous curiosity, and the love of
seeing and observing whatever was most remarkable,
whether in the past ages, or the
present.</p>

<p>Amongst other things that amused them,
they were much taken with the great church
at <i>Warwick</i>. They entertained themselves
with the several histories, which it’s many old
monuments recalled to their memory<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>. The
famous inscription of Sir <span class="smcap">Fulk Grevil</span> occasioned
some reflexions; especially to Mr.
<span class="smcap">Digby</span>, who had used to be much affected with
the fame and fortunes of the accomplished Sir
<span class="smcap">Philip Sidney</span>. The glory of the house of
<span class="smcap">Warwick</span> was, also, an ample field of meditation.
But what chanced to take their attention
most, was the monument of the great earl
of <span class="smcap">Leicester</span>. It recorded his titles at full
length, and was, besides, richly decorated with
sculpture, displaying the various ensigns and
trophies of his greatness. The pride of this
minister had never appeared to them so conspicuous,
as in the legends and ornaments of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
his tomb-stone; which had not only outlived
his family, but seemed to assure itself of immortality,
by taking refuge, as it were, at the
foot of the altar.</p>

<p>These funeral honours engaged them in some
common reflexions on the folly of such expedients
to perpetuate human grandeur; but at
the same time, as is the usual effect of these
things, struck their imaginations very strongly.
They readily apprehended what must have been
the state of this mighty favourite in his lifetime,
from what they saw of it in this proud
memorial, which continued in a manner to insult
posterity so many years after his death.
But understanding that the fragments at least
of his supreme glory, when it was flourishing
at its height, were still to be seen at <span class="smcap">Kenelworth</span>,
which they knew could be at no great
distance, they resolved to visit them the next
day, and indulge to the utmost the several reflexions
which such scenes are apt to inspire.
On enquiry, they found it was not more than
five or six miles to the castle; so that, by starting
early in the morning, they might easily return
to dinner at <i>Warwick</i>. They kept to
their appointment so well, that they got to
<i>Kenelworth</i> in good time, and had even two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
or three hours on their hands to spend, in taking
an exact view of the place.</p>

<p>It was luckily one of those fine days, which
our travellers would most have wished for, and
which indeed are most agreeable in this season.
It was clear enough to afford a distinct prospect
of the country, and to set the objects, they
wanted to take a view of, in a good light; and
yet was so conveniently clouded as to check the
heat of the sun, and make the exercise of walking,
of which they were likely to have a good
deal, perfectly easy to them.</p>

<p>When they alighted from the coach, the first
object that presented itself was the principal
<span class="smcap">Gate-way</span> of the Castle. It had been converted
into a farm-house, and was indeed the only
part of these vast ruins that was inhabited. On
their entrance into the <i>inner-court</i>, they were
struck with the sight of many mouldering
towers, which preserved a sort of magnificence
even in their ruins. They amused themselves
with observing the vast compass of the whole,
with marking the uses, and tracing the dimensions,
of the several parts. All which it was
easy for them to do, by the very distinct traces
that remained of them, and especially by means
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
of <span class="smcap">Dugdale’s</span> plans and descriptions, which
they had taken care to consult.</p>

<p>After rambling about for some time, they
clambered up a heap of ruins, which lay on the
west side the court: and thence came to a
broken tower, which, when they had mounted
some steps, led them out into a path-way on
the tops of the walls. From this eminence they
had a very distinct view of the several parts
they had before contemplated; of the <i>gardens</i>
on the north-side; of the <i>winding meadow</i> that
encompassed the walls of the castle, on the
west and south; and had, besides, the command
of the country round about them for
many miles. The prospect of so many antique
towers falling into rubbish, contrasted to the
various beauties of the landscape, struck them
with admiration, and kept them silent for some
time.</p>

<p>At length recovering himself, I perceive, said
Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, we are all of us not a little
affected with the sight of these ruins. They
even create a melancholy in me; and yet a
melancholy of so delightful a kind, that I would
not exchange it, methinks, for any brisker sensation.
The experience of this effect hath often
led me to enquire, how it is that the mind,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
even while it laments, finds so great a pleasure
in visiting these scenes of desolation. Is it,
continued he, from the pure love of antiquity,
and the amusing train of reflexions into which
such remains of ancient magnificence naturally
lead us?</p>

<p>I know not, returned Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, what
pain it may give you to contemplate these
triumphs of time and fortune. For my part, I
am not sensible of the mixt sensation you speak
of. I feel a pleasure indeed; but it is sincere,
and, as I conceive, may be easily accounted
for. ’Tis nothing more, I believe, than a fiction
of the imagination, which makes me think
I am taking a revenge on the once prosperous
and overshadowing height, <span class="smcap">PR&AElig;UMBRANS FASTIGIUM</span>,
as somebody expresses it, of inordinate
Greatness. It is certain, continued he,
this theatre of a great statesman’s pride, the delight
of many of our princes, and which boasts
of having given entertainment to one of them
in a manner so splendid, as to claim a remembrance,
even in the annals of our country, would
now, in its present state, administer ample
matter for much insulting reflexion.</p>

<p>“Where, one might ask, are the tilts and
tournaments, the princely shows and sports,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
which were once so proudly celebrated within
these walls? Where are the pageants, the
studied devices and emblems of curious invention,
that set the court at a gaze, and even
transported the high soul of our <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>?
Where now, pursued he, (pointing to that
which was formerly a canal, but at present is
only a meadow with a small rivulet running
through it) where is the floating island, the
blaze of torches that eclipsed the day, the lady
of the lake, the silken nymphs her attendants,
with all the other fantastic exhibitions surpassing
even the whimsies of the wildest romance? What
now is become of the revelry of feasting? of
the minstrelsy, that took the ear so delightfully
as it babbled along the valley, or floated on the
surface of this lake? See there the smokeless
kitchens, stretching to a length that might
give room for the sacrifice of a hecatomb; the
vaulted hall, which mirth and jollity have set
so often in an uproar; the rooms of state, and
the presence-chamber: what are they now but
void and tenantless ruins, clasped with ivy,
open to wind and weather, and representing
to the eye nothing but the ribs and carcase, as
it were, of their former state? And see, said
he, that proud gate-way, once the mansion of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
a surly porter<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>, who, partaking of the pride
of his lord, made the crowds wait, and refused
admittance, perhaps, to nobles whom fear or
interest drew to these walls, to pay their homage
to their master: see it now the residence
of a poor tenant, who turns the key but to let
himself out to his daily labour, to admit him to
a short meal, and secure his nightly slumbers.
Yet, in this humble state, it hath had the
fortune to outlive the glory of the rest, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
hath even drawn to itself the whole of that little
note and credit which time hath continued to
this once pompous building. For, while the
castle itself is crumbled into shapeless ruins,
and is prophaned, as we there see, by the vilest
uses, this outwork of greatness is left entire,
sheltered and closed in from bird and beast,
and even affords some decent room in which
the <i>human face divine</i> is not ashamed to shew
itself.”</p>

<p>While Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> went on in this vein,
his two friends stood looking on each other;
as not conceiving what might be the cause of
his expressing himself with a vehemence, so
uncommon, and not suited to his natural temper.
When the fit was over, I confess, said
Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, this is no bad topic for a
moralist to declaim upon. And, though it be
a trite one, we know how capable it is of being
adorned by him who, on a late occasion, could
meditate so finely on the <span class="smcap">Tombs at Westminster</span><a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>.
But surely, proceeded he, you warm
yourself in this contemplation, beyond what
the subject requires of you. The vanity of
human greatness is seen in so many instances,
that I wonder to hear you harangue on this with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
so peculiar an exultation. There is no travelling
ten miles together in any part of the kingdom
without stumbling on some ruin, which,
though perhaps not so considerable as this before
us, would furnish occasion, however, for
the same reflexions. There would be no end of
moralizing over every broken tower, or shattered
fabric, which calls to mind the short-lived
glories of our ancestors.</p>

<p>True, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>; and, if the short
continuance of these glories were the only circumstance,
I might well have spared the exultation,
you speak of, in this triumph over the
shattered remnants of <i>Kenelworth</i>. But there
is something else that fires me on the occasion.
It brings to mind the fraud, the rapine, the
insolence, of the potent minister, who vainly
thought to immortalize his ill-gotten glory by
this proud monument. Nay, further, it awakens
an indignation against the prosperous
tyranny of those wretched times, and creates a
generous pleasure in reflecting on the happiness
we enjoy under a juster and more equal government.
Believe me, I never see the remains of
that greatness which arose in the past ages on the
ruins of public freedom and private property,
but I congratulate with myself on living at a
time, when the meanest subject is as free and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
independent as those royal minions; and when
his property, whatever it be, is as secure from
oppression, as that of the first minister. And
I own this congratulation is not the less sincere
for considering that the instance before us is
taken from the reign of the virgin queen, which
it hath been the fashion to cry up above that
of any other of our princes<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>. I desire no other
confutation of so strange unthankful a preference,
than the sight of this vast castle, together
with the recollection of those means by
which its master arrived at his enormous greatness.</p>

<p>Your indignation then, replied Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
is not so much of the moral, as <i>political</i>
kind<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>. But is not the conclusion a little too
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
hasty, when, from the instance of one overgrown
favourite, you infer the general infelicity
of the time, in which he flourished? I am not,
I assure you, one of those unthankful men who
forget the blessings they enjoy under a prince
of more justice and moderation than queen
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, and under a better constitution of
government than prevailed in the days of our
forefathers. Yet, setting aside some particular
dishonours of that reign (of which, let the
tyranny of <i>Leicester</i>, if you will, be one), I
see not but the acknowledged virtues of that
princess, and the wisdom of her government,
may be a proper foundation for all the honours
that posterity have ever paid to her.</p>

<p>Were I even disposed to agree with you, returned
Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, I should not have the
less reason for triumphing, as I do, on the
present state of our government. For, if such
abuses could creep in, and be suffered for so
many years under so great a princess, what was
there not to fear (as what, indeed, did not the
subject actually feel) under some of her successors?
But, to speak my mind frankly, I
see no sufficient grounds for the excessive prejudice,
that hath somehow taken place, in favour
of the <small>GOLDEN REIGN</small>, as it is called, <span class="smcap">of
Elizabeth</span>. I find neither the wisdom, nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
the virtue in it, that can entitle it to a preference
before all other ages.</p>

<p>On the contrary, said Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, I
never contemplate the monuments of that time,
without a silent admiration of the virtues that
adorned it. Heroes and sages crowd in upon
my memory. Nay, the very people were of a
character above what we are acquainted with in
our days. I could almost fancy, the soil itself
were another face, and, as you poets imagine
on some occasions, that our ancestors lived
under a brighter sun and happier climate than
we can boast of.</p>

<p>To be sure! said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, smiling: or,
why not affirm, in the proper language of romance,
that the women of those days were all
chaste, and the men valiant? But cannot you
suspect at least that there is some enchantment
in the case, and that your love of antiquity
may possibly operate in more instances than
those of your favourite <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>?
Tell me honestly, pursued he, hath not this
distance of a century and a half a little imposed
upon you? Do not these broken towers, which
moved you just now to so compassionate a lamentation
over them, dispose you to a greater
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
fondness for the times in which they arose, than
can be fairly justified?</p>

<p>I will not deny, returned Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
but we are often very generous to the past times,
and unjust enough to the present. But I think
there is little of this illusion in the case before
us. And, since you call my attention to these
noble ruins, let me own to you, that they do
indeed excite in me a veneration for the times
of which they present so striking a memorial.
But surely not without reason. For there is
scarce an object in view, that doth not revive
the memory of some distinguishing character
of that age, which may justify such veneration.</p>

<p>Alas! interrupted Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, and what
can these objects call to mind but the memory
of barbarous manners and a despotic government?</p>

<p>For the <i>government</i>, replied Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
I do not well conceive how any conclusion
about that can be drawn from this fabric. The
<small>MANNERS</small> I was thinking of; and I see them
strongly expressed in many parts of it. But
whether barbarous or not, I could almost take
upon me to dispute with you. And why, indeed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
since you allowed yourself to declaim on
the vices, so apparent, as you suppose, in this
monument of antiquity, may not I have leave
to consider it in another point of view, and
present to you the virtues which, to my eye at
least, are full as discernible?</p>

<p>You cannot, continued he, turn your eyes on
any part of these ruins, without encountering
some memorial of the virtue, industry, or ingenuity,
of our ancestors.</p>

<p>Look there, said he, on that fine room
(pointing to the <small>HALL</small>, that lay just beneath
them); and tell me if you can help respecting
the <small>HOSPITALITY</small> which so much distinguished
the palaces of the great in those simpler ages.
You gave an invidious turn to this circumstance
when you chose to consider it only in the light
of wasteful expence and prodigality. But no
virtue is privileged from an ill name. And, on
second thoughts, I persuade myself, it will appear
you have injured this, by so uncandid an
appellation. Can it deserve this censure, that
the lord of this princely castle threw open his
doors and spread his table for the reception of
his friends, his followers, and even for the
royal entertainment of his sovereign? Is any
expence more proper than that which tends to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
conciliate<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> friendships, spread the interests of
society, and knit mankind together by a generous
communication in these advantages of
wealth and fortune? The arts of a refined sequestered
luxury were then unknown. The
same bell, that called the great man to his
table, invited the neighbourhood all around,
and proclaimed a holiday to the whole country<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>.
Who does not feel the decorum,
and understand the benefits of this magnificence?
The pre-eminence of rank and fortune
was nobly sustained: the subordination of society
preserved: and yet the envy, that is so
apt to attend the great, happily avoided. Hence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
this weight and influence of the old nobility,
who engaged the love, as well as commanded
the veneration, of the people. In the mean
time, rural industry flourished: private luxury
was discouraged: and in both ways that frugal
simplicity of life, our country’s grace and
ornament in those days, was preserved and promoted.</p>

<p>It would spoil your panegyric, I doubt, said
Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, to observe the factious use, that
was made of this magnificence, and the tendency
it had to support the pride and insolence of the
old nobility. The interest of the great, I am
afraid, was but another name for the slavery of
the people<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>I see it, Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span> said, in a different
light; and so did our princes themselves, who
could not but be well acquainted with the proper
effects of that interest. They considered
the weight of the nobility, as a counterpoise to
their own sovereignty. It was on this account
they had used all means to lessen their influence.
But the consequence was beside their
expectation. The authority of the crown fell
with it: and, which was still less expected by
political men, the liberty of the people, after
it had wantoned for a time, sunk under the general
oppression. It was then discovered, but
a little of the latest, that public freedom throve
best, when it wound itself about the stock of
the ancient nobility. In truth, it was the defect,
not the excess, of patrician influence, that
made way for the miseries of the next century.</p>

<p>You see then it is not without cause that I
lay a stress, even in a political view, on this
popular hospitality of the great in the former
ages<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>But, lest you think I sit too long at the
table, let us go on to the <small>TILTYARD</small>, which lies
just before us; that school of fortitude and honour
to our generous forefathers. A younger
fancy, than mine, would be apt to kindle at
the sight. And our sprightlier friend here, I
dare say, has already taken fire at the remembrance
of the gallant exercises, which were celebrated
in that quarter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Digby</span> owned, he had a secret veneration
for the manly games of that time, which
he had seen so triumphantly set forth in the
old poets and romancers.</p>

<p>Right, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>; it is precisely in
that circumstance that the enchantment consists.
Some of our best wits have taken a deal
of idle pains to ennoble a very barbarous
entertainment, and recommend it to us under
the specious name of gallantry and honour.
But Mr. <span class="smcap">Digby</span> sees through the cheat. Not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
that I doubt, continued he, but the Doctor,
now he is in the vein of panegyric, will lay a
mighty stress on these barbarities; and perhaps
compare them with the exercises in the <i>Roman</i>
Circus, or the <i>Olympic</i> Barriers.</p>

<p>And why not? interrupted Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>.
The tendency of all three was the same; to invigorate
the faculties both of mind and body;
to give strength, grace, and dexterity, to the
limbs; and fire the mind with a generous
emulation of the manly and martial virtues.</p>

<p>Why truly, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, I shall not
deny that all <i>three</i>, as you observe, were much
of the same merit. And, now your hand is in
for this sort of encomium, do not forget to celebrate
the sublime taste of our forefathers for
<i>bear-baiting</i><a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>, as well as <i>tilting</i>; and tell us
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
too, how gloriously the mob of those days, as
well as their betters, used to belabour one
another.</p>

<p>I confess, said Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, the softness
of our manners makes it difficult to speak on
this subject without incurring the ridicule, you
appear so willing to employ against me. But
you must not think to discredit these gymnastics
by a little raillery, which has its foundation
only in modern prejudices. For it is no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
secret that the gravest and politest men of antiquity
were of my mind. You will hardly
suspect <span class="smcap">Plato</span> of incivility, either in his notions
or manners. And need I remind you how much
he insists on the gymnastic discipline; without
which he could not have formed, or at least
have supported, his Republic?</p>

<p>It was upon this principle, I suppose then,
said Mr. <span class="smcap">Digby</span>, or perhaps in imitation of his
<i>Gr&aelig;cian</i> master, that our <span class="smcap">Milton</span> laid so great
a stress on this discipline in his <small>TRACTATE OF
EDUCATION</small>. And before him, in the very time
you speak of, <span class="smcap">Ascham</span>, I observe, took no
small pains to much the same purpose in his
<span class="smcap">Toxophilus</span>.</p>

<p>It is very clear, resumed Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
from these instances, and many more that
might be given, that the ancients were not singular
in their notions on this subject. But,
since you have drawn me into a grave defence
of these exercises, let me further own to you
that I think the <i>Gothic</i> Tilts and Tournaments
exceeded, both in use and elegance, even the
<i>Gr&aelig;cian</i> gymnastics<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>. They were a more
direct image of war, than any of the games at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
<i>Olympia</i>. And if <i>Xenophon</i> could be so lavish
in his praises on the <i>Persian</i> practice of hunting,
because it had some resemblance to the
exercise of arms, what would he not have said
of an institution, which has all the forms of a
real combat?</p>

<p>But there was an elegance, too, in the
conduct of the tournament, that might reconcile
it even to modern delicacy. For, besides
the splendor of the shew; the dexterity, with
which these exercises were performed; and the
fancy, that appeared in their accoutrement,
dresses, and devices; the whole contest was
ennobled with an air of gallantry, that must
have had a great effect in refining the manners
of the combatants. And yet this gallantry had
no ill influence on morals; for, as you insulted
me just now, it was the odd humour of those
days for the women to pride themselves in their
chastity<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>, as well as the men in their valour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>In short, I consider the <i>Tournay</i>, as the
best school of civility as well as heroism.
“High-erected thoughts, seated in a heart of
courtesy,” as an old writer<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> well expresses it,
was the proper character of such as had been
trained in this discipline.</p>

<p>No wonder then, pursued he, the poets and
romance-writers took so much pains to immortalize
these trials of manhood. It was but
what <span class="smcap">Pindar</span> and <span class="smcap">Homer</span> himself, those ancient
masters of romance, had done before
them. And how could it be otherwise? The
shew itself, as I said, had something very taking
in it; whilst every graceful attitude of person,
with every generous movement of the mind,
afforded the finest materials for description.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
And I am even ready to believe, that what we
hear censured in their writings, as false, incredible,
and fantastic, was frequently but a just
copy of life, and that there was more of truth
and reality<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> in their representations, than we
are apt to imagine. Their notions of honour
and gallantry were carried to an elevation<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
which, in these degenerate days, hurts the
credit of their story; just as I have met with
men that have doubted whether the virtues of
the <span class="smcap">Reguli</span> and the <span class="smcap">Scipios</span> of ancient fame
were not the offspring of pure fancy.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>Nay now, Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
you grow quite extravagant. What you,
who are used to be so quick at espying all
abuses in science, and defects in good taste,
turn advocate for these fopperies! Mr. <span class="smcap">Digby</span>
and I shall begin to think you banter us, in
this apology for the ancient gymnastics, and
are only preparing a chapter for the facetious
memoirs<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>, you sometimes promise us.</p>

<p>Never more in earnest, assure you, replied
the Doctor. I know what you have to object
to these pictures of life and manners. But, if
they will not bear examining as copies, they
may deserve to be imitated as models. And
their use, methinks, might atone for some defects
in the article of probability.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>For my part, I consider the legends of ancient
chivalry in a very serious light,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As <i>niches</i>, fill’d with statues to invite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young valours forth&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>as <span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span>, a valorous hardy poet, and
who, himself, would have made a good
knight-errant, justly says of them. For, it is
certain, they had this effect. The youth, in
general, were fired with the love of martial exercises.
They were early formed to habits of
fatigue and enterprise. And, together with
this warlike spirit, the profession of chivalry
was favourable to every other virtue. Affability,
courtesy, generosity, veracity, these
were the qualifications most pretended to by
the men of arms, in the days of pure and uncorrupted
chivalry. We do not perhaps, ourselves,
know, at this distance of time, how
much we are indebted to the force of this singular
institution. But this I may presume to
say, that the men, among whom it arose and
flourished most, had prodigious obligations to
it. No policy, even of an ancient legislator,
could have contrived a better expedient to cultivate
the manners and tame the spirits of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
rude and ignorant people. I could almost
fancy it providentially introduced among the
northern nations, to break the fierceness of
their natures, and prevent that brutal savageness
and ferocity of character, which must
otherwise have grown upon them in the darker
ages.</p>

<p>Nay, the generous sentiments, it inspired,
perhaps contributed very much to awaken an
emulation of a different kind; and to bring on
those days of light and knowledge which have
disposed us, somewhat unthankfully, to vilify
and defame it. This is certain, that the first
essays of wit and poetry, those harbingers of
returning day to every species of good letters,
were made in the bosom of chivalry, and amidst
the assemblies of noble dames, and courteous
knights. And we may even observe, that the
best of our modern princes, such as have been
most admired for their personal virtues, and
have been most concerned in restoring all the
arts of civility and politeness, have been passionately
addicted to the feats of ancient prowess.
In the number of these, need I remind you of
the courts of <span class="smcap">Francis I</span>, and <span class="smcap">Henry IV</span>, to say
nothing of our own <span class="smcap">Edwards</span> and <span class="smcap">Henrys</span>,
and that mirrour of all their virtues in one,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
our renowned and almost romantic <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span><a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>?</p>

<p>But you think I push the argument too far.
And less than this may dispose you to conceive
with reverence of the scene before us, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
must ever be regarded as a nursery of brave
men, a very seed-plot of warriors and heroes.
I consider the successes at the barriers as
preludes to future conquests in the field. And, as
whimsical a figure as a young tilter may make
in your eye, who will say that the virtue was
not formed here, that triumphed at <span class="smcap">Axell</span>, and
bled at <span class="smcap">Zutphen</span>?</p>

<p>We shall very readily, replied Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
acknowledge the bravery and other virtues of
the young hero, whose fortunes you hint at.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
He was, in truth, to speak the language of that
time, the very flower of knighthood, and contributed
more than any body else, by his pen,
as well as sword, to throw a lustre on the profession
of chivalry. But the thing itself, however
adorned by his wit and recommended by
his manners, was barbarous; the offspring of
<i>Gothic</i> fierceness; and shews the times, which
favoured it so much, to have scarcely emerged
from their original rudeness and brutality.
You may celebrate, as loudly as you please,
the deeds of these wonder-working knights.
Alas, what affinity have such prodigies to our
life, and manners? The old poet, you quoted
just now with approbation, shall tell us the
difference:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These were bold stories of our <i>Arthur’s</i> age:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here are other acts, another stage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scene appears; it is not since as then;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No giants, dwarfs, or monsters here, but <small>MEN</small><a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Or, if you want a higher authority, we should
not, methinks, on such an occasion, forget the
admirable <span class="smcap">Cervantes</span>, whose ridicule hath
brought eternal dishonour on the profession of
knight-errantry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<p>With your leave, interrupted Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
I have reason to except against both your
authorities. At best, they do but condemn the
<i>abuses</i> of chivalry, and the madness of continuing
the old romantic spirit in times when,
from a change of manners and policy, it was
no longer in season. Adventures, we will say,
were of course to cease, when giants and monsters
disappeared. And yet have they totally
disappeared, and have giants and monsters
been no where heard of out of the castles and
forests of our old romancers. ’Tis odds, methinks,
but, in the sense of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span> good
subjects, <span class="smcap">Philip II.</span> might be a <i>giant</i> at least:
and, without a little of this adventurous spirit,
it may be a question whether all her enchanters,
I mean her <span class="smcap">Burleighs</span> and <span class="smcap">Walsinghams</span>,
would have proved a match for him. I mention
this the rather to shew you, how little
obligation his countrymen have to your <span class="smcap">Cervantes</span>
for laughing away the remains of that
prowess, which was the best support of the
<i>Spanish</i> monarchy.</p>

<p>As if, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, the prowess of
any people were only to be kept alive by their
running mad. But let the case of the <i>Spaniards</i>
be what it will, surely we, of this country,
have little obligation to the spirit of chivalry, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
it were only that it produced, or encouraged
at least, and hath now entailed upon us, the
curse of duelling; which even yet domineers in
the fashionable world, in spite of all that wit,
and reason, and religion itself, have done to
subdue it. ’Tis true, at present this law of
arms is appealed to only in the case some
high point of nice and mysterious honour.
But in the happier days you celebrate, it was
called in aid, on common occasions. Even
questions of right and property, you know,
were determined at the barriers<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>: and brute
force was allowed the most equitable, as well
as shortest, way of deciding all disputes both
concerning a man’s estate and honour.</p>

<p>You might observe too, interposed Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
that this was the way in which those
fiercer disputes concerning a mistress, or a
kingdom, were frequently decided. And, if
this sort of decision, in such cases, were still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
in use among Christian princes, you might call
it perhaps a barbarous custom: but would it
be ever the worse, do you think, for their good
subjects?</p>

<p>Perhaps it would not, returned Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
in some instances. And yet will you affirm,
that those <i>good subjects</i> were in any enviable
situation, under their fighting masters?
After all, allowing you to put the best construction
you can on these usages of our forefathers,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">“all we find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is, that they did their work and din’d.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And though such feats may argue a sound athletic
constitution, you must excuse me, if I am
not forward to entertain any high notions of
their civility.</p>

<p>Their civility, said Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, is another
consideration. The <small>HALL</small> and <small>TILT-YARD</small>
are certainly good proofs of what they are alleged
for, the hospitality and bravery of our
ancestors. But it hath not been maintained,
that these were their only virtues. On the
contrary, it seems to me, that every flower of
humanity, every elegance of art and genius,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
was cultivated amongst them. For an instance,
need we look any further than the <small>LAKE</small>, which
in the flourishing times of this castle was so
famous, and which we even now trace in the
winding bed of that fine meadow?</p>

<p>I do not understand you, replied Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>.
I can easily imagine what an embellishment
that lake must have been to the castle;
but am at a loss to conceive what flowers of
wit and ingenuity, to use your own &aelig;nigmatical
language, could be raised or so much as
watered by it.</p>

<p>And, have you then, returned Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
so soon forgotten the large description,
you gave us just now, of the shows and pageants
displayed on this lake? And can any
thing better declare the art, invention, and ingenuity,
of their conductors? Is not this canal
as good a memorial of the ardour and success
with which the finer exercises of the mind were
pursued in that time, as the tilt-yard, we have
now left, is of the address and dexterity shewn
in those of the body?</p>

<p>I remember, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, that many
of the shows, intended for the queen’s entertainment
at this place, were exhibited on that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
canal. But as to any art or beauty of contrivance&mdash;</p>

<p>“You see none, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Why truly none, resumed Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>.
To me they seemed but well enough suited to
the other barbarities of the time. “The Lady
of the Lake and her train of Nereids,” was not
that the principal? And can it pass for any
thing better than a jumble of <i>Gothic</i> romance
and pagan fable? a barbarous modern conceit,
varnished over with a little classical pedantry?</p>

<p>And is that the best word you can afford,
said Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, to these ingenious devices?
The business was, to welcome the Queen
to this palace, and at the same time to celebrate
the honours of her government. And what
more decent way of complimenting a great
Prince, than through the veil of fiction? or
what so elegant way of entertaining a learned
Prince, as by working up that fiction out of
the old poetical story? And if something of the
<i>Gothic</i> romance adhered to these classical fictions,
it was not for any barbarous pleasure,
that was taken in this patchwork, but that the
artist found means to incorporate them with
the highest grace and ingenuity. For what,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
in other words, was the <i>Lady of the Lake</i> (the
particular that gives most offence to your delicacy),
but the presiding nymph of the stream,
on which these shews were presented? And, if
the contrivance was to give us this nymph under
a name that romance had made familiar,
what was this but taking advantage of a popular
prejudice to introduce his fiction with more
address and probability?</p>

<p>But see the propriety of the scene itself, for
the designer’s purpose, and the exact decorum
with which these fanciful personages were
brought in upon it. It was not enough, that
the pagan deities were summoned to pay their
homage to the queen. They were the deities
of the fount and ocean, the watery nymphs
and demi-gods: and these were to play their
part in their own element. Could any preparation
be more artful for the panegyric designed
on the naval glory of that reign? Or, could
any representation be more grateful to the
queen of the ocean, as <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> was then
called, than such as expressed her sovereignty
in those regions? Hence the sea-green Nereids,
the Tritons, and Neptune himself, were the
proper actors in the drama. And the opportunity
of this spacious lake gave the easiest introduction
and most natural appearance to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
whole scenery. Let me add too, in further
commendation of the taste which was shewn in
these agreeable fancies, that the attributes and
dresses of the deities themselves were studied
with care; and the most learned poets of the
time employed to make them speak and act in
character. So that an old <i>Greek</i> or <i>Roman</i>
might have applauded the contrivance, and
have almost fancied himself assisting at a religious
ceremony in his own country.</p>

<p>And, to shew you that all this propriety was
intended by the designer himself, and not imagined
at pleasure by his encomiast; I remember,
that when, some years after, the earl of
<span class="smcap">Hertford</span> had the honour to receive the queen
at his seat in <i>Hampshire</i>, because he had no
such canal as this in readiness on the occasion,
he set on a vast number of hands to hollow a
bason in his park for that purpose. With so
great diligence and so exact a decorum were
these entertainments conducted!</p>

<p>Did not I tell you, interposed Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
addressing himself to Mr. <span class="smcap">Digby</span>, to what an
extravagance the Doctor’s admiration of the ancient
times would carry him? Could you have
expected all this harangue on the art, elegance,
and decorum of <span class="smcap">the princely pleasures of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
Kenelworth</span><a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>? And must not it divert you
to see the unformed genius of that age tricked
out in the graces of <i>Roman</i> or even <i>Attic</i> politeness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Digby</span> acknowledged, it was very generous
in the Doctor to represent in so fair a
light the amusements of the ruder ages. But
I was thinking, said he, to what cause it could
possibly be owing, that these pagan fancies had
acquired so general a consideration in the days
of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.</p>

<p>The general passion for these fancies, returned
Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, was a natural consequence
of the revival of learning. The first
books, that came into vogue, were the poets.
And nothing could be more amusing to rude
minds, just opening to a taste of letters, than
the fabulous story of the pagan gods, which is
constantly interwoven in every piece of ancient
poetry. Hence the imitative arts of <i>sculpture</i>,
<i>painting</i>, and <i>poetry</i>, were immediately employed
in these pagan exhibitions. But this
was not all. The first artists in every kind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
were of <i>Italy</i>; and it was but natural for them
to act these fables over again on the very spot
that had first produced them. These too were
the masters to the rest of <i>Europe</i>. So that
<i>fashion</i> concurred with the other prejudices of
the time, to recommend this practice to the
learned.</p>

<p>From the men of art and literature the enthusiasm
spread itself to the great; whose supreme
delight it was to see the wonders of the
old poetical story brought forth, and realized,
as it were, before them<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>. And what, in truth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
could they do better? For, if I were not a
little afraid of your raillery, I should desire to
know what courtly amusements even of our
time are comparable to the shows and masques,
which were the delight and improvement of
the court of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>. I say, the <i>improvement</i>;
for, besides that these shows were not
in the number of the <span class="smcap">INERUDIT&AElig; VOLUPTATES</span>,
so justly characterized and condemned by a
wise ancient, they were even highly useful and
instructive. These devices, composed out of
the poetical history, were not only the vehicles
of compliment to the great on certain solemn
occasions, but of the soundest moral lessons,
which were artfully thrown in, and recommended
to them by the charm of poetry and
numbers. Nay, some of these masques were
moral dramas in form, where the virtues and
vices were impersonated. We know the cast
of their composition by what we see of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
fictions in the next reign; and have reason to
conceive of them with reverence when we find
the names of <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span> and <span class="smcap">Jonson</span><a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> to some
of them. I say nothing of <span class="smcap">Jones</span> and <span class="smcap">Lawes</span>,
though all the elegance of their respective arts
was called in to assist the poet in the contrivance
and execution of these entertainments.</p>

<p>And, now the poets have fallen in my way,
let me further observe, that the manifest superiority
of this class of writers in <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span>
reign, and that of her successor, over all others
who have succeeded to them, is, among other
reasons, to be ascribed to the taste which then
prevailed for these moral representations. This
taught them to animate and impersonate every
thing. Rude minds, you will say, naturally
give into this practice. Without doubt. But
art and genius do not disdain to cultivate and
improve it. Hence it is, that we find in the
phraseology and mode of thinking of that time,
and of that time only, the essence of the truest
and sublimest poetry.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>Without doubt, Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> said, the poetry
of that time is of a better taste than could
well have been expected from its barbarism in
other instances. But such prodigies as <span class="smcap">Shakespear</span>
and <span class="smcap">Spenser</span> would do great things in
any age, and under every disadvantage.</p>

<p>Most certainly they would, returned Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
but not the things that you admire
so much in these immortal writers. And, if
you will excuse the intermixture of a little philosophy
in these ramblings, I will attempt to
account for it.</p>

<p>There is, I think, in the revolutions of taste
and language, a certain point, which is more
favourable to the purposes of poetry, than any
other. It may be difficult to fix this point
with exactness. But we shall hardly mistake
in supposing it lies somewhere between the rude
essays of uncorrected fancy, on the one hand,
and the refinements of reason and science, on
the other.</p>

<p>And such appears to have been the condition
of our language in the age of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>. It
was pure, strong, and perspicuous, without
affectation. At the same time, the high figurative
manner, which fits a language so peculiarly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
for the uses of the poet, had not yet been
controlled by the prosaic genius of philosophy
and logic. Indeed, this character had been
struck so deeply into the <i>English</i> tongue, that
it was not to be removed by any ordinary improvements
in either: the reason of which
might be, the delight which was taken by the
<i>English</i> very early in their old <small>MYSTERIES</small> and
<small>MORALITIES</small>; and the continuance of the same
spirit in succeeding times, by means of their
<small>MASQUES</small> and <small>TRIUMPHS</small>. And something like
this, I observe, attended the progress of the
<i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i> poetry; which was the <i>truest</i>
poetry, on the clown’s maxim in <span class="smcap">Shakespear</span>,
because it was <i>the most feigning</i><a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>. It had its
rise, you know, like ours, from religion: and
pagan religion, of all others, was the properest
to introduce and encourage a spirit of allegory
and moral fiction. Hence we easily account
for the allegoric cast of their old dramas, which
have a great resemblance to our ancient moralities.
<span class="smcap">Necessity</span> is brought in as a <i>person of
the drama</i>, in one of <span class="smcap">&AElig;schylus’s</span> plays; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
<span class="smcap">Death</span> in one of <span class="smcap">Euripides</span>: to say nothing of
many shadowy persons in the comedies of
<span class="smcap">Aristophanes</span>. The truth is, the pagan religion
<i>deified</i> every thing, and delivered these
deities into the hand of their painters, sculptors,
and poets. In like manner, Christian superstition,
or, if you will, modern barbarism,
<i>impersonated</i> every thing; and these persons, in
proper form, subsisted for some time on the stage,
and almost to our days, in the masques. Hence
the picturesque style of our old poetry; which
looks so fanciful in <span class="smcap">Spenser</span>, and which <span class="smcap">Shakespear’s</span>
genius hath carried to the utmost sublimity.</p>

<p>I will not deny, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, but
there may be something in this deduction of
the causes, by which you account for the
strength and grandeur of the <i>English</i> poetry,
unpolished as it still was in the hands of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span>
great poets. But for the masques
themselves&mdash;</p>

<p>You forget, I believe, <i>one</i>, interrupted Dr.
<span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, which does your favourite poet,
<span class="smcap">Milton</span>, almost as much honour, as his <i>Paradise
Lost</i>.&mdash;But I have no mind to engage in
a further vindication of these fancies. I only
conclude that the taste of the age, the state of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
letters, the genius of the <i>English</i> tongue,
was such as gave a manliness to their compositions
of all sorts, and even an elegance to
those of the lighter forms, which we might do
well to emulate, and not deride, in this &aelig;ra of
politeness.</p>

<p>But I am aware, as you say, I have been
transported too far. My design was only to
hint to you, in opposition to your invective
against the memory of the old times, awakened
in us by the sight of this castle, that what
you object to is capable of a much fairer interpretation.
You have a proof of it, in two
or three instances; in their festivals, their exercises,
and their poetical fictions: or, to express
myself in the classical forms, you have
seen by this view of their <small>CONVIVIAL</small>, <small>GYMNASTIC</small>,
and <small>MUSICAL</small> character, that the times of
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> may pass for golden, notwithstanding
what a fondness for this age of baser metal
may incline us to represent it.</p>

<p>In the mean time, these smaller matters
have drawn me aside from my main purpose.
What surprised me most, pursued he, was to
hear you speak so slightly, I would not call it
by a worse name, of the <small>GOVERNMENT</small> of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.
Of the manners and tastes of different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
ages, different persons, according to their
views of things, will judge very differently.
But plain facts speak so strongly in favour of
the policy of that reign, and the superior talents
of the sovereign, that I could not but
take it for the wantonness of opposition in you
to espouse the contrary opinion. And, now I
am warmed by this slight skirmish, I am even
bold enough to dare you to a defence of it; if,
indeed, you were serious in advancing that
strange paradox. At least, I could wish to
hear upon what grounds you would justify so
severe an attack on the reverend administration
of that reign, supported by the wisdom of such
men as <span class="smcap">Cecil</span> and <span class="smcap">Walsingham</span>, under the
direction of so accomplished a princess as our
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>. Your manner of defending even
the wrong side of the question will, at least, be
entertaining. And, I think, I may answer for
our young friend, that his curiosity will lead
him to join me in this request to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> said, He did not expect to be
called to so severe an account for what had
escaped him on this subject. But, though I
was ever so willing, continued he, to oblige
you, this is no time or place for entering on
such a controversy. We have not yet compleated
the round of these buildings. And I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
would fain, methinks, make the circuit of that
pleasant meadow. Besides its having been
once, in another form, the scene of those shows
you described so largely to us, it will deserve
to be visited for the sake of the many fine views
which, as we wind along it, we may promise
to ourselves of these ruins.</p>

<p>You forget my bad legs, said Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>
smiling; otherwise, I suppose, we can
neither of us have any dislike to your proposal.
But, as you please: let us descend from these
heights. We may resume the conversation, as
we walk along: and especially, as you propose,
when we get down into that valley.

<h3>MR. DIGBY, DR. ARBUTHNOT,
MR. ADDISON.</h3>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">But</span> do you consider, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
as they descended into the valley, what an invidious
task you are going to impose upon me?
One cannot call in question a common opinion
in any indifferent matter, without the appearance
of some degree of perverseness. But to
do it in a case of this importance, where the
greatest authorities stand in the way, and the
glory of one of our princes is concerned, will,
I doubt, be liable to the imputation of something
worse than singularity. For, besides
that you will be apt to upbraid me, in the
words of the poet,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Nullum memorabile nomen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fœmine&acirc; in pœn&acirc; est, nec habet victoria laudem,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>such a liberty of censure is usually taken for
an argument, not of discourtesy or presumption
only, but of ill-nature. At best, the attempt
to arraign the virtues and government of
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> will appear but like the idleness of
the old sophists, who, you know, were never
so well pleased as when they were controverting
some acknowledged fact, or assaulting some
established character.</p>

<p>That censure might be just enough, Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>
said, of the old sophists, who had
nothing in view but the credit of their own
skill in the arts of disputation. But in this
friendly debate, which means nothing more
than private amusement, I see no colour for
such apprehensions.</p>

<p>But what shall we say, interposed Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
to another difficulty? The subject is
very large; and it seems no easy matter to reduce
it into any distinct order. Besides, my
business is not so much to advance any thing
of my own, as to object to what others have
advanced concerning the fame and virtues of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>. And to this end, I must desire
to know the particulars on which you are disposed
to lay the greatest stress, and indeed to
have some plan of the subject delivered in to
me, which may serve, as it were, for the groundwork
of the whole conversation.</p>

<p>I must not presume, said Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
to prescribe the order in which your attack on
the great queen shall be conducted. The subject,
indeed, is large. But this common route
of history is well known to all of us. To that,
then, you may well enough refer, without being
at the trouble, before you go to work, of
laying foundations. Or, if you will needs have
a basis to build upon, what if I just run over
the several circumstances which I conceive to
make most for the credit of that reign? A
sketch of this sort, I suppose, will answer all
the ends of the plan, you seem to require of
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> agreed to this proposal; which
he thought would be of use to shorten the debate,
or at least to render the progress of it
more clear and intelligible.</p>

<p>In few words then, resumed Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
the reasons, that have principally determined
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
me to an admiration of the government
and character of queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, are such as
these: “That she came to the crown with all
possible disadvantages; which yet, by the prudence
and vigour of her counsels, she entirely
overcame: that she triumphed over the greatest
foreign and domestic dangers: that she humbled
the most formidable power in <i>Europe</i> by her
arms; and composed, or checked at least, by
the firmness of her administration, <small>TWO</small>, the
most implacable and fiery factions at home:
that she kept down the rebellious spirit of <i>Ireland</i>,
and eluded the constant intrigues of her
restless neighbours, the <i>Scots</i>: that she fixed
our religious establishment on solid grounds;
and countenanced, or rather conducted, the
Protestant cause abroad: that she made her
civil authority respected by her subjects; and
raised the military glory of the nation, both by
sea and land, to the greatest height: that she
employed the ablest servants, and enacted the
wisest laws: by all which means it came to
pass that she lived in a constant good understanding
with her parliaments, was idolized by
her people, and admired and envied by all the
rest of the world.”</p>

<p>Alas, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, I shall never be
able to follow you through all the particulars
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
of this encomium: and, to say the truth, it
would be to little purpose; since the wisdom
of her policy, in all these instances of her government,
can only be estimated from a careful
perusal of the histories of that time; too numerous
and contradictory to be compared and
adjusted in this conversation. All I can do,
continued he, after taking a moment or two to
recollect himself, is to abate the force of this
panegyric by some general observations of the
<small>CIRCUMSTANCES</small> and <small>GENIUS</small> of that time; and
then to consider the personal <small>QUALITIES</small> of the
queen, which are thought to reflect so great a
lustre on her government.</p>

<p>As you please, Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span> replied.
We shall hardly lose ourselves in this beaten
field of history. And, besides, as your undertaking
is so adventurous, it is but reasonable
you should have the choice of your own method.</p>

<p>You are in the common opinion, I perceive,
resumed Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, that <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span> government
was attended with all possible disadvantages.
On the contrary, it appears to me
that the security and even splendour of her
reign is chiefly to be accounted for from the
fortunate <small>CIRCUMSTANCES</small> of her situation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<p>Of these the <small>FIRST</small>, that demands our notice,
is the great affair of religion.</p>

<p>The principles of <span class="smcap">Protestantism</span> had now
for many years been working among the people.
They had grown to that head in the short reign
of <span class="smcap">Edward VI.</span> that the bloody severities of
his successor served only to exasperate the zeal,
with which these principles had been embraced
and promoted. <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, coming to the
crown at this juncture, was determined, as well
by interest as inclination, to take the side of
the new religion. I say by <i>interest</i>, as well as
inclination. And, I think, I have reason for
the assertion. For though the persons in
power, and the clergy throughout the kingdom,
were generally professed papists; yet
they were most of them such as had conformed
in king <span class="smcap">Edward’s</span> days, and were not therefore
much to be feared for any tie, their <i>profession</i>
could really have on their consciences.
Whereas, on the other hand, it was easy to
see, from many symptoms, that the general
bent of the nation was towards Protestantism;
and that, too, followed with a spirit, which
must in the end prevail over all opposition.
Under these circumstances, then, it was natural
for the queen, if she had not been otherwise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
led by her principles, and the interest of her
title, to favour the Reformation.</p>

<p>The truth is, she came into it herself so
heartily, and provided so effectually for its
establishment, that we are not to wonder she
became the idol of the Reformed, at the
same time that the papal power through all
<i>Europe</i> was confederated against her. The
enthusiasm of her Protestant subjects was prodigious.
It was raised by other considerations;
but confirmed in all orders of the state by the
ease they felt in their deliverance from the tyranny
of the church; and in the great especially,
by the sweets they tasted in their enjoyment
of the church-revenues. It was, in short,
one of those extraordinary conjunctures, in
which the public danger becomes the public security;
when religion and policy, conscience and
interest, unite their powers to support the authority
of the prince, and to give fidelity, vigour,
and activity to the obedience of the subject.</p>

<p>And thus it was, continued he, that so warm
and unconquerable a zeal appeared in defence
of the queen against all attempts of her enemies.
Her people were so thoroughly Protestant,
as to think no expence of her government
too great, provided they could but be secured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
from relapsing into Popery. And her parliaments
were disposed to wave all disputes about
the stretch of her prerogative, from a sense of
their own and the common danger.</p>

<p>In magnifying this advantage of the zeal and
union of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span> good subjects, you forgot,
said Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, that two restless and
inveterate factions were contending, all her lifetime,
within her own kingdom.</p>

<p>I am so far from forgetting that circumstance,
returned Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, that I esteem it <small>ANOTHER</small>
of the great advantages of her situation.</p>

<p>The contrary tendencies of those factions in
some respects defeated each other. But the
principal use of them was, that, by means of
their practices, some domestic plot, or foreign
alarm, was always at hand, to quicken the zeal
and inflame the loyalty of her people. But to
be a little more particular about the factions of
her reign.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Papist</span> was, in truth, the only one she
had reason to be alarmed at. The <span class="smcap">Puritan</span>
had but just begun to shew himself, though indeed
with that ferocity of air and feature,
which signified clearly enough what spirit he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
was of, and what, in good time, he was likely
to come to. Yet even he was kept in tolerable
humour, by a certain commodious policy of
the queen; which was, so to divide her regards
betwixt the Church and the Puritans, as
made it the interest of both to keep well with
her. ’Tis true, these last felt the weight of her
resentment sometimes, when they ventured too
saucily to oppose themselves to the establishment.
But this was rarely, and by halves:
and, when checked with the most rigour, they
had the satisfaction to see their patrons continue
in the highest places at court, and, what
is more, in the highest degree of personal
favour.</p>

<p>And what doth all this shew, interrupted
Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, but that she managed so well
as to disarm a furious faction, or rather make
it serve against the bent of its nature, to the
wise ends of her government?</p>

<p>As to any wise ends of government, I see
none, replied Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, deserving to be so
called, that were answered by her uncertain
conduct towards the Puritans. For she neither
restrained them with that severity, which might
perhaps have prevented their growth, at first;
nor shewed them that entire indulgence, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
might have disabled their fury afterwards. It
is true, this temporizing conduct was well
enough adapted to prevent disturbances in her
own time. But large materials were laid in
for that terrible combustion, which was soon
to break forth under one of her successors.</p>

<p>And so, instead of imputing the disasters
that followed, said Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, to the ill-government
of the <span class="smcap">Stuarts</span>, you are willing to
lay the whole guilt of them on this last and
greatest of the <span class="smcap">Tudors</span>. This is a new way of
defending that royal house; and, methinks,
they owe you no small acknowledgments for it.
I confess, it never occurred to me to make that
apology for them.</p>

<p>Though I would not undertake, said Mr.
<span class="smcap">Addison</span>, to make their apology from this, or
any other, circumstance; I do indeed believe
that part of the difficulties the house of <span class="smcap">Stuart</span>
had to encounter, were brought upon them by
this wretched policy of their predecessor. But,
waving this consideration, I desire you will
take notice of what I chiefly insist upon,
“That the ease and security of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span>
administration was even favoured by the turbulent
practices and clashing views of her domestic
factions.” The <span class="smcap">Puritan</span> was an instrument,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
in her hands, of controuling the church,
and of balancing the power of her ministers:
besides that this sort of people were, of all
others, the most inveterate against the common
enemy. And for the <span class="smcap">Papists</span> themselves (not
to insist that, of course, they would be strictly
watched, and that they were not, perhaps, so
considerable as to create any immediate danger<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>),
the general abhorrence both of their principles
and designs had the greatest effect in
uniting more closely, and cementing, as it were,
the affections of the rest of her subjects. So
that, whether within or without, the common
danger, as I expressed it, was the common
safety.</p>

<p>Still, said Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, I must think this
a very extraordinary conclusion. I have no
idea of the security of the great queen, surrounded,
as she was, by her domestic and foreign
enemies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p>Her foreign enemies, returned Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
were less formidable than they appear at first
view. And I even make the condition of the
neighbouring powers on the Continent, in her
time, a <small>THIRD</small> instance of the signal advantages
of her situation.</p>

<p>It is true, if a perfect union had subsisted
between the Catholic princes, the papal thunders
would have carried terror with them. But,
as it was, they were powerless and ineffectual.
The civil wars of <i>France</i>, and its constant jealousy
of <i>Spain</i>, left the queen but little to apprehend
from that quarter. The <i>Spanish</i> empire,
indeed, was vast, and under the direction
of a bigoted vindictive prince. But the administration
was odious and corrupt in every
part. So that wise men saw there was more of
bulk than of force in that unwieldy monarchy.
And the successful struggles of a handful of its
subjects, inflamed by the love of liberty, and
made furious by oppression, proclaimed its
weakness to all the world.</p>

<p>It may be true, interrupted Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
that the queen had less to fear from the princes
on the Continent, than is sometimes represented.
But you forget, in this survey of the
public dangers, the distractions of <span class="smcap">Ireland</span>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
and the restless intrigues of her near neighbours,
the <span class="smcap">Scots</span>: both of them assisted by
<i>Spain</i>; and these last under the peculiar influence
and direction of the <span class="smcap">Guises</span>.</p>

<p>You shall have my opinion, returned Mr.
<span class="smcap">Addison</span>, in few words.</p>

<p>For the <span class="smcap">Irish</span> distractions, it was not the
queen’s intention, or certainly it was not her
fortune, to compose them: I mean, during the
greatest part of her reign; for we are now
speaking of the general tenor of her policy.
Towards the close of it, indeed, she made some
vigorous attempts to break the spirits of those
savages. And it was high time she should.
For, through her faint proceedings against them,
they had grown to that insolence, as to think
of setting up for an independency on <i>England</i>.
Nay, the presumption of that arch-rebel <span class="smcap">Tyrone</span>,
countenanced and abetted by <i>Spain</i>,
seemed to threaten the queen with still further
mischiefs. The extreme dishonour and even
peril of this situation roused her old age, at
length, to the resolution of taking some effectual
measures. The preparation was great, and
suitable to the undertaking. It must, further,
be owned, it succeeded: but so late, that she
herself did not live to see the full effect of it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
However, this success is reckoned among the
glories of her reign. In the mean time, it is
not considered that nothing but her ill policy,
in suffering the disorders of that country to
gather to a head, made way for this glory. I
call it her <i>ill policy</i>, for unless it were rather
owing to her excessive frugality<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> one can hardly
help thinking she designed to perpetuate the
<i>Irish</i> distractions. At least, it was agreeable
to a favourite maxim of hers, to check, and not
to suppress them. And I think it clear, from
the manner of prosecuting the war, that, till
this last alarm, she never was in earnest about
putting an end to it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scotland</span>, indeed, demanded a more serious
attention. Yet the weak distracted counsels of
that court&mdash;a minor king&mdash;a captive queen&mdash;and
the unsettled state of <i>France</i> itself, which
defeated in a good degree the malice of the
<span class="smcap">Guises</span>&mdash;were favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>But to be fair with you (for I would appear
in the light of a reasonable objector, not a captious
wrangler); I allow her policy in this instance
to have been considerable. She kept a
watchful eye on the side of <i>Scotland</i>. And,
though many circumstances concurred to favour
her designs, it must be owned they were
not carried without much care and some wisdom.</p>

<p>I understand the value of this concession,
replied Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>. It must have been
no common degree of both, that extorted it
from you.</p>

<p>I decline entering further, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
into the public transactions of that reign;
if it were only that, at this distance of time, it
may be no easy matter to determine any thing
of the policy, with which they were conducted.
Only give me leave to add, as a <small>FOURTH</small> instance
of the favourable circumstances of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
time, “That the prerogative was then in its
height, and that a patient people allowed the
queen to use it on all occasions.” Hence the
apparent vigour and firmness of her administration:
and hence the opportunity (which is so
rarely found in our country) of directing the
whole strength of the nation to any end of government,
which the glory of the prince or
the public interest required.</p>

<p>What you impute to the high strain of prerogative,
returned Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, might rather
be accounted for from the ability of her
government, and the wise means she took to
support it. The principal of these was, by employing
the <small>GREATEST MEN</small> in the several departments
of her administration. Every kind
of merit was encouraged by her smile<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>, or rewarded
by her bounty. Virtue, she knew,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
would thrive best on its native stock, a generous
emulation. This she promoted by all
means; by her royal countenance, by a temperate
and judicious praise, by the wisest distribution
of her preferments. Hence would
naturally arise that confidence in the queen’s
counsels and undertakings, which the servile
awe of her prerogative could never have occasioned.</p>

<p>This is the true account of the loyalty,
obedience, and fidelity, by which her servants
were distinguished. And thus, in fact, it was
that, throughout her kingdom, there was every
where that reverence of authority<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>, that sense
of honour, that conscience of duty, in a word,
that gracious simplicity of manners, which
renders the age of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> truly <small>GOLDEN</small>:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
as presenting the fairest picture of humanity,
that is to be met with in the accounts of any
people.</p>

<p>It is true, as you say, interposed Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
that <i>this picture is a fair one</i>. But
of what is it a copy? Of the <span class="smcap">Genius</span> of the
time, or of the queen’s virtues? You shall
judge for yourself, after I have laid before you
<small>TWO</small> remarkable events of that age, which
could not but have the greatest effect on the
public manners; I mean, <small>THE REFORMATION
OF RELIGION</small>, and what was introductory of it,
<small>THE RESTORATION OF LETTERS</small>. From these,
as their proper sources, I would derive the
ability and fidelity of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span> good subjects.</p>

<p>The passion for <small>LETTERS</small> was extreme. The
novelty of these studies, the artifices that had
been used to keep men from them, their apparent
uses, and, perhaps, some confused notion
of a certain diviner virtue than really belongs
to them; these causes concurred to excite
a curiosity in all, and determined those, who
had leisure, as well as curiosity, to make themselves
acquainted with the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Roman</i>
learning. The ecclesiastics, who, for obvious
reasons, would be the first and most earnest in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
their application to letters, were not the only
persons transported with this zeal. The gentry
and nobility themselves were seized with it.
A competent knowledge of the old writers was
looked upon as essential to a gentleman’s education.
So that <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> became as
fashionable at court in those days, as <i>French</i> is
in ours. <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> herself, which I wonder
you did not put me in mind of, was well
skilled in both<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>; they say, employed her
leisure in making some fine translations out of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
either language. It is easy to see what effect
this general attention to letters must have on
the minds of the liberal and well-educated.
And it was a happiness peculiar to that age,
that learning, though cultivated with such zeal,
had not as yet degenerated into pedantry: I
mean, that, in those stirring and active times,
it was cultivated, not so much for show, as
use; and was not followed, as it soon came to
be, to the exclusion of other generous and
manly applications.</p>

<p>Consider, too, the effects, which the alterations
in <small>RELIGION</small> had produced. As they had
been lately made, as their importance was great,
and as the benefits of the change had been
earned at the expence of much blood and labour:
all these considerations begot a zeal for
religion, which hardly ever appears under other
circumstances. This zeal had an immediate
and very sensible effect on the morals of the
Reformed. It improved them in every instance;
especially as it produced a cheerful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
submission to the government, which had rescued
them from their former slavery, and was
still their only support against the returning
dangers of superstition. Thus religion, acting
with all its power, and that, too, heightened
by gratitude and even self-interest, bound
obedience on the minds of men with the
strongest ties<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>. And luckily for the queen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
this obedience was further secured to her by
the high uncontroverted notions of royalty,
which, at that time, obtained amongst the
people.</p>

<p>Lay all this together; and then tell me
where is the wonder that a people, now
emerging out of ignorance; uncorrupted by
wealth, and therefore undebauched by luxury;
trained to obedience, and nurtured in simplicity;
but, above all, caught with the love of
learning and religion, while neither of them
was worn for fashion-sake, or, what is worse,
perverted to the ends of vanity or ambition;
where, say, is the wonder that such a people
should present so bright a picture of manner’s
to their admiring panegyrist?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>To be fair with you; it was one of those
conjunctures, in which the active virtues are
called forth, and rewarded. The dangers of
the time had roused the spirit, and brought out
all the force and genius, of the nation. A sort
of enthusiasm had fired every man with the
ambition of exerting the full strength of his
faculties, which way soever they pointed, whether
to the field, the closet, or the cabinet.
Hence such a crop of soldiers, scholars, and
statesmen had sprung up, as have rarely been
seen to flourish together in any country. And
as all owed their duty, it was the fashion of the
times for all to bring their pretensions, to the
court. So that, where the multitude of candidates
was so great, it had been strange indeed,
if an ordinary discretion had not furnished the
queen with able servants of all sorts; and the
rather, as her occasions loudly called upon her
to employ the ablest.</p>

<p>I was waiting, said Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, to see
to what conclusion this career of your eloquence
would at length drive you. And it hath happened
in this case, as in most others where a
favourite point is to be carried, that a zeal for
it is indulged, though at the expence of some
other of more importance. Rather than admit
the personal virtues of the queen, you fill her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
court, nay, her kingdom, with heroes and sages:
and so have paid a higher compliment to her
reign, than I had intended.</p>

<p>To her <i>reign</i>, if you will, replied Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
so far as regards the qualities and dispositions
of her subjects: for I will not lessen the
merit of this concession with you, by insisting,
as I might, that their <i>manners</i>, respectable as
they were, were debased by the contrary, yet
very consistent, vices of servility and insolence<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>;
and their virtues of every kind deformed by,
barbarism. But, for the queen’s own merit in
the choice of her servants, I must take leave to
declare my sentiments to you very plainly. It
may be true, that she possessed a good degree
of sagacity in discerning the natures and talents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
of men. It was the virtue by which, her admirers
tell us, she was principally distinguished.
Yet, that the high fame of this virtue hath
been owing to the felicity of the times, abounding
in all sorts of merit, rather than to her own
judgment, I think clear from this circumstance,
“That some of the most deserving of those
days, in their several professions, had not the
fortune to attract the queen’s grace, in the proportion
they might have expected.” I say
nothing of poor <span class="smcap">Spenser</span>. Who has any concern
for a poet<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>? But if merit alone had determined
her majesty’s choice, it will hardly at
this day admit a dispute, that the immortal
<span class="smcap">Hooker</span> and <span class="smcap">Bacon</span><a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>, at least, had ranked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
in another class than that, in which this great
discerner of spirits thought fit to leave them.</p>

<p>And her character; continued he, in every
other respect is just as equivocal. For having
touched one part of it, I now turn from these
general considerations on the circumstances
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
and genius of the time, to our more immediate
subject, the <small>PERSONAL QUALITIES</small> of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.
Hitherto we have stood aloof from the queen’s
person. But there is no proceeding a step further
in this debate, unless you allow me a little
more liberty. May I then be permitted to
draw the veil of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span> court, and, by the
lights which history holds out to us, contemplate
the mysteries, that were celebrated in that
awful sanctuary?</p>

<p>After so reverend a preface, replied Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
I think you may be indulged in this
liberty. And the rather, as I am not apprehensive
that the honour of the illustrious queen
is likely to suffer by it. The secrets of her
cabinet-council, it may be, are not to be
scanned by the profane. But it will be no presumption
to step into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>Yet I may be tempted, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
to use a freedom in this survey of her majesty,
that would not have been granted to her most
favoured courtiers. As far as I can judge of
her character, as displayed in that solemn scene
of her court, she had some apparent <small>VIRTUES</small>,
but more genuine <small>VICES</small>; which yet, in the
public eye, had equally the fortune to reflect
a lustre on her government.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>Her gracious affability, her love of her people,
her zeal for the national glory; were not
these her more obvious and specious qualities?
Yet I doubt they were not so much the proper
effects of her nature, as her policy; a set of
spurious virtues, begotten by the very necessity
of her affairs.</p>

<p>For her <small>AFFABILITY</small>, she saw there was no
way of being secure amidst the dangers of all
sorts, with which she was surrounded; but by
ingratiating herself with the body of the people.
And, though in her nature she was as
little inclined to this condescension as any of
her successors, yet the expediency of this measure
compelled her to save appearances. And
it must be owned, she did it with grace, and
even acted her part with spirit. Possibly the
consideration of her being a female actor, was
no disadvantage to her.</p>

<p>But, when she had made this sacrifice to interest,
her proper temper shewed itself clearly
enough in the treatment of her nobles, and of
all that came within the verge of the court.
Her caprice, and jealousy, and haughtiness,
appeared in a thousand instances. She took
offence so easily, and forgave so difficultly,
that even her principal ministers could hardly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
keep their ground, and were often obliged to
redeem her favour by the lowest submissions.
When nothing else would do, they sickened,
and were even at death’s door: from which
peril, however, she would sometimes relieve
them; but not till she had exacted from them,
in the way of penance, a course of the most
mortifying humiliations. Nay, the very ladies
of her court had no way to maintain their
credit with her, but by, submitting patiently
to the last indignities.</p>

<p>It is allowed, from the instances you have in
view, returned Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, that her nature
was something high and imperious. But
these sallies of passion might well enough consist
with her general character of affability.</p>

<p>Hardly, as I conceive, answered Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
if you reflect that these sallies, or rather
habits of passion, were the daily terror
and vexation of all about her. Her very minions
seemed raised for no other purpose, than
the exercise of her ill-humour. They were encouraged,
by her smile, to presume on the
royal countenance, and then beaten down
again in punishment of that presumption.
But, to say the truth, the slavish temper of
the time was favourable to such exertions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
female caprice and tyranny. Her imperious
father, all whose virtues, she inherited, had
taught her a sure way to quell the spirit of her
nobles. They had been long used to stand in
awe of the royal frown. And the people were
pleased to find their betters ruled with so high
a hand, at a time when they themselves were
addressed with every expression of respect, and
even flattery.</p>

<p>She even carried this mockery so far, that,
as <span class="smcap">Harrington</span> observes well, “she converted
her reign, through the perpetual love-tricks
that passed between her and her people, into
a kind of romance.” And though that political
projector, in prosecution of his favourite notion,
supposes the queen to have been determined
to these intrigues by observing, that
the weight of property was fallen into the popular
scale; yet we need look no further for an
account of this proceeding, than the inherent
haughtiness of her temper. She gratified the
insolence of her nature, in neglecting, or rather
beating down, her nobility, whose greatness
might seem to challenge respect: while
the court, she paid to the people, revolted her
pride less, as passing only upon herself, as
well as others, for a voluntary act of affability.
Just as we every day see very proud men carry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
it with much loftiness towards their equals, or
those who and raised to some nearness of degree
to themselves; at the same time that they
affect a sort of courtesy to such, as are confessedly
beneath them.</p>

<p>You see, then, what her boasted affability
comes to. She gave good words to her people,
whom it concerned her to be well with, and
whom her pride itself allowed her to <i>manage</i>:
she insulted her nobles, whom she had in her
power, and whose abasement flattered the idea,
she doted upon, of her own superiority and importance<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>.</p>

<p>Let the queen’s manner of treating her subjects
be what it would, Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span> said,
it appears to have given no offence in those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
days, when the sincerity of her intentions was
never questioned. Her whole life is a convincing
argument; that she bore the most entire
affection to her people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her love of her people</span>, returned Mr.
<span class="smcap">Addison</span> hastily, is with me a very questionable
virtue. For what account shall we give
of the multitude of penal statutes, passed in
her reign? Or, because you will say, there
was some colour for these; what excuse shall
we make for her frequent grants of monopolies,
so ruinous to the public wealth and happiness,
and so perpetually complained of by her parliaments?
You will say, she recalled them.
She did so. But not till the general indignation
had, in a manner, forced her to recall
them. If by her <i>people</i>, be meant those of
the poorer and baser sort only, it may be allowed,
she seemed on all occasions willing to
spare them. But for those of better rank and
fortune, she had no such consideration. On
the other hand, she contrived in many ways to
pillage and distress them. It was the tameness
of that time, to submit to every imposition
of the sovereign. She had only to command
her gentry on any service she thought fit, and
they durst not decline it. How many of her
wealthiest and best subjects did she impoverish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
by these means (though under colour, you may
be sure, of her high favour); and sometimes by
her very visits! I will not be certain, added he,
that her visit to this pompous castle of her own
<span class="smcap">Leicester</span>, had any other intention.</p>

<p>But what, above all, are we to think of her
vow of celibacy, and her obstinate refusal to
settle the succession, though at the constant
hazard of the public peace and safety?</p>

<p>You are hard put to it, I perceive, interrupted.
Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, to impeach the character
of the queen in this instance, when a few
penal laws, necessary to the support of her
crown in that time of danger; one wrong measure
of her government, and that corrected;
the ordinary use of her prerogative; and even
her virginity; are made crimes of. But I am
curious to hear what you have to object to her
<span class="smcap">zeal for the English glory</span>, carried so high
in her reign; and the single point, as it seems
to me, to which all her measures and all her
counsels were directed.</p>

<p>The <i>English</i> glory, Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> said, may,
perhaps, mean the state and independency of
the crown. And then, indeed, I have little to
object. But, in any other sense of the word,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
I have sometimes presumed to question with
myself, if it had not been better consulted, by
more effectual assistance of the Reformed on
the Continent; by a more vigorous prosecution
of the war against <i>Spain</i><a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>; as I hinted
before, by a more complete reduction of <i>Ireland</i>.
But say, we are no judges of those high
matters. What glory accrued to the <i>English</i>
name, by the insidious dealing with the queen
of <i>Scots</i>; by the vindictive proceedings
against the duke of <i>Norfolk</i>; by the merciless
persecutions of the unhappy earl of <i>Essex</i>?
The same spirit, you see, continued from the
beginning of this reign to the end of it. And
the observation is the better worth attending
to, because some have excused the queen’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
treatment of <span class="smcap">Essex</span> by saying, “That her nature,
in that decline of life, was somewhat
clouded by apprehensions; as the horizon, they
observe, in the evening of the brightest day,
is apt to be obscured by vapours<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>.” As if this
fanciful simile, which illustrates perhaps, could
excuse, the perverseness of the queen’s temper;
or, as if that could deserve to pass for an
incident of age, which operated through life;
and so declares itself to have been the proper
result of her nature.</p>

<p>You promised, interposed Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
not to pry too closely into the secrets of the
cabinet. And such I must needs esteem the
points to be, which you have mentioned. But
enough of these beaten topics. I would rather
attend you in the survey you promised to take
of her court, and of the princely qualities that
adorned it. It is from what passes in the inside
of his palace, rather than from some questionable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
public acts, that the real character of
a prince is best determined. And there, methinks,
you have a scene opened to you, that
deserves your applause. Nothing appears but
what is truly royal. Nobody knew better,
than <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, how to support the decorum
of her rank. She presided in that high orb
with the dignity of a great queen. In all
emergencies of danger, she shewed a firmness,
and, on all occasions of ceremony, a magnificence,
that commanded respect and admiration.
Her very diversions were tempered with
a severity becoming her sex and place, and
which made her court, even in its lightest and
gayest humours, a school of virtue.</p>

<p>These are the points, concluded he, I could
wish you to speak to. The rest may be left to
the judgment of the historian, or rather to the
curiosity of the nice and critical politician.</p>

<p>You shall be obeyed, Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> said.
I thought it not amiss to take off the glare
of those applauded qualities, which have dazzled
the public at a distance, by shewing that they
were either feigned or over-rated. But I come
now to unmask the real character of this renowned
princess. I shall paint her freely indeed,
but truly as she appears to me. And,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
to speak my mind at once; I think it is not so
much to her virtues, which at best were equivocal,
as to her very <small>VICES</small>, that we are to impute
the popular admiration of her character
and government.</p>

<p>I before took notice of the high, indecent
<small>PASSION</small>, she discovered towards her courtiers.
This fierceness of temper in the softer sex was
taken for heroism; and, falling in with the
slavish principles of the age, begot a degree of
reverence in her subjects, which a more equal,
that is a more becoming, deportment would
not have produced. Hence, she was better
served than most of our princes, only because
she was more feared; in other words, because
she less deserved to be so. But high as she
would often carry herself in this unprincely, I
had almost said, unwomanly, treatment of her
servants; awing the men by her oaths, and
her women by blows; it is still to be remembered,
that she had a great deal of natural
<small>TIMIDITY</small> in her constitution.</p>

<p>What! interrupted Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span> hastily,
the magnanimous <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> a coward? I
should as soon have expected that charge
against <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sar</span> himself, or your own <span class="smcap">Marlborough</span>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<p>I distinguish, Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> said, betwixt
a parade of courage, put on to serve a turn,
and keep her people in spirits, and that true
greatness of mind, which, in one word, we
call <i>magnanimity</i>. For this last, I repeat
it, she either had it not, or not in the degree
in which it has been ascribed to her. On the
contrary, I see a littleness, a pusillanimity, in
her conduct on a thousand occasions. Hence
it was, that both to her people and such of the
neighbouring states as she stood in awe of, she
used an excessive hypocrisy, which, in the
language of the court, you may be sure, was
called policy. To the <i>Hollanders</i>, indeed, she
could talk big; and it was not her humour to
manage those over whom she had gained an
ascendant. This has procured her, with many,
the commendation of a princely magnanimity.
But, on the other hand, when discontents
were apprehended from her subjects, or when
<i>France</i> was to be diverted from any designs
against her, no art was forgotten that might
cajole their spirits with all the professions of
cordiality and affection. Then she was <i>wedded</i>,
that was the tender word, to her people: and
then the interest of religion itself was sacrificed
by this Protestant queen to her newly-perverted
brother on the Continent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>Her foible, in this respect, was no secret to
her ministers. But, above all, it was practised
upon most successfully by the Lord <span class="smcap">Burghley</span>;
“for whom, as I have seem it observed,
it was as necessary that there should be treasons,
as for the state that they should be prevented<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>.”
Hence it was, that he was perpetually raising
her fears, by the discovery of some plot, or,
when that was wanting, by the proposal of
some law for her greater security. In short,
he was for ever finding, or making, or suggesting,
dangers. The queen, though she
would look big (for indeed she was an excellent
actress), startled at the shadows of those
dangers, the slightest rumours. And to this
convenient timidity of his mistress, so constantly
alarmed, and relieved in turn by this
wily minister, was owing, in a good degree,
that long and unrivalled interest, he held in
her favour.</p>

<p>Still, further, to this constitutional <i>fear</i>
(which might be forgiven to her sex, if it had
not been so strangely mixed with a more than
masculine ferocity in other instances) must be
ascribed those favourite maxims of policy,
which ran through her whole government.
Never was prince more attached to the Machiavelian
doctrine, <small>DIVIDE ET IMPERA</small>, than our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span><a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>. It made the soul of her policies,
domestic and foreign. She countenanced the
two prevailing factions of the time. The
Churchmen and Puritans divided her favour so
equally, that her favourites were sure to be the
chiefs of the contending parties. Nay, her
court was a constant scene of cabals and personal
animosities. She gave a secret, and sometimes
an open, countenance to these jealousies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
The same principle directed all her foreign<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>
negociations.</p>

<p>And are you not aware, interrupted Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>,
that this objected policy is the very
topic that I, and every other admirer of the
queen, would employ in commendation of her
great ability in the art of government? It has
been the fate of too many of our princes (and
perhaps some late examples might be given) to
be governed, and even insulted, by a prevailing
party of their own subjects. <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> was
superior to such attempts. She had no bye-ends
to pursue. She frankly threw herself on
her people. And, secure in their affection,
could defeat at pleasure, or even divert herself
with, the intrigues of this or that aspiring faction.</p>

<p>We understand you, Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> replied;
but when two parties are contending within a
state, and one of them only in its true interest,
the policy is a little extraordinary that should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
incline the sovereign to discourage <i>this</i>, from
the poor ambition of controuling <i>that</i>, or, as
you put it still worse, from the dangerous
humour of playing with <i>both</i> parties. I say
nothing of later times. I only ask; if it was indifferent,
whether the counsels of the <span class="smcap">Cecils</span>
or of <span class="smcap">Leicester</span> were predominant in that
reign? But I mentioned these things before,
and I touch them again now, only to shew
you, that this conduct, however it may be varnished
over by the name of wisdom, had too
much the air of fearful womanish intrigue, to
consist with that heroical firmness and intrepidity
so commonly ascribed to queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span><a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>.</p>

<p>And what if, after all, I should admit, replied
Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, that, in the composition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
of a woman’s courage, at least, there might be
some scruples of discretion? Is there any advantage,
worth contending for, you could draw
from such a concession? Or, because you
would be thought serious, I will put the matter
more gravely. The arts of prudence, you arraign
so severely, could not be taken for pusillanimity.
They certainly were not, in her own
time; for she was not the less esteemed or
revered by all the nations of <i>Europe</i> on account
of them. The most you can fairly conclude
is, that she knew how to unite address with
bravery, and that, on occasion, she could <i>dissemble</i>
her high spirit. The difficulties of
her situation obliged her to this management.</p>

<p>Rather say at once, returned Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>,
that the constant dissimulation, for which she
was so famous, was assumed to supply the want
of a better thing, which had rendered all those
arts as unnecessary as they were ignoble.</p>

<p>But <i>haughtiness</i> and <i>timidity</i>, pursued he,
were not the only vices that turned to good account
in the queen’s hands. She was frugal
beyond all bounds of decorum in a prince, or
rather <small>AVARICIOUS</small> beyond all reasonable excuse
from the public wants and the state of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
revenue. Nothing is more certain than this
fact, from the allowance both of friends and
enemies. It seems as if, in this respect, her
father’s example had not been sufficient; and
that, to complete her character, she had incorporated
with many of his, the leading vice of
her grandfather.</p>

<p>Here Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span> could not contain
himself; and the castle happening at that time,
from the point where they stood, to present
the most superb prospect, “Look there, said
he, on the striking, though small, remnants of
that grandeur you just now magnified so much;
and tell me if, in your conscience, you can believe
such grants are the signs, or were the effects,
of avarice. For you are not to learn,
that this palace before us is not the only one
in the kingdom, which bears the memory of the
queen’s bounty to her servants.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> seemed a little struck with the
earnestness of this address: “It is true, said
he, the queen’s fondness for one or two of her
favourites made her sometimes lavish of her
grants; especially of what cost her nothing,
and did not, it seems, offend the delicacy of
her scruples; I mean, of the <i>church-lands</i>.
But at the same time her treasury was shut
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
against her ambassadors and foreign ministers;
who complain of nothing more frequently than
the slenderness of their appointments, and the
small and slow remittances that were made to
them. This frugality (for I must not call it
by a worse name) distressed the public service
on many occasions<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>; and would have done it
on more, if the zeal of her trusty servants had
not been content to carry it on at the expence
of their own fortunes. How many instances
might be given of this, if <small>ONE</small> were not more
than sufficient, and which all posterity will remember
with indignation!</p>

<p>You speak of <span class="smcap">Walsingham</span>, interposed Dr.
<span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>. But were it not more candid to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
impute the poverty of that minister to his own
generous contempt of riches, which he had
doubtless many, fair occasions of procuring to
himself, than to any designed neglect of him
by his mistress?</p>

<p>The candour, returned Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, must
be very extraordinary, that can find an excuse
for the queen in a circumstance that doubles
her disgrace. But be it as you pretend. The
uncommon moderation of the man shall be a
cover to the queen’s parsimony. It was not,
we will say, for this wise princess to provoke
an appetite for wealth in her servants: it was
enough that she gratified it, on proper occasions,
where she found it already raised. And
in this proceeding, no doubt, she was governed
by a tender regard, for their honour, as well as
her own interest. For how is her great secretary
ennobled, by filling a place in the short
list of those worthies, who, having lived and
died in the service of their countries, have left
not so much as a pittance behind them, to
carry them to their graves! All this is very
well. But when she had indulged this humour
in one or two of her favourites, and suffered
them, for example’s sake, to ascend to these
heights of honour, it was going, methinks, a
little too far, to expect the same delicacy of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
virtue in all her courtiers. Yet it was not her
fault, if most of them did not reap this fame
of illustrious poverty, as well as <span class="smcap">Walsingham</span>.
She dealt by them, indeed, as if she had ranked
poverty, as well as celibacy, among the cardinal
virtues.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I would not deny that
she had a princely fondness for shew and appearance.
She took a pride in the brilliancy
of her court. She delighted in the large trains
of her nobility. She required to be royally
entertained by them. And she thought her
honour concerned in the figure they made in
foreign courts, and in the wars. But, if she
loved this pomp, she little cared to furnish the
expence of it. She considered in good earnest
(as some have observed, who would have the
observation pass for a compliment<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>) <i>the purses</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
<i>of her subjects as her own</i>; and seemed to
reckon on their being always open to her on
any occasion of service, or even ceremony.
She carried this matter so far, that the very
expences of her wars were rather defrayed out
of the private purses of her nobility, than the
public treasury. As if she had taken it for a
part of her <i>prerogative</i> to impoverish her
nobles at pleasure; or rather, as if she had a
mind to have it thought that one of their <i>privileges</i>
was, to be allowed to ruin themselves
from a zeal to her service.</p>

<p>But the queen’s avarice, proceeded he, did
not only appear from her excessive parsimony
in the management of the public treasure, but
from her rapacity in getting what she could
from particulars into her privy purse. Hence
it was that all offices, and even personal favours,
were in a manner set to sale. For it
was a rule with her majesty, to grant no suit
but for a reasonable consideration. So that
whoever pretended to any place of profit or
honour was sure to send a jewel, or other rich
present beforehand, to prepare her mind for
the entertainment of his petition. And to
what other purpose was it that she kept her
offices so long vacant, but to give more persons
an opportunity of winning a preference in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
favour; which for the most part inclined to
those who had appeared, in this interval, to
deserve it best? Nay, the slightest disgust,
which she frequently took on very frivolous
occasions, could not be got over but by the reconciling
means of some valuable or well fancied
present. And, what was most grievous,
she sometimes accepted the present, without
remitting the offence.</p>

<p>I remember a ridiculous instance of this sort.
When the Lady <span class="smcap">Leicester</span> wanted to obtain
the pardon of her unfortunate son, the Lord
<span class="smcap">Essex</span>, she presented the queen with an exceeding
rich gown, to the value of above an
hundred pounds. She was well pleased with
the gift, but thought no more of the pardon.
We need not, after this, wonder at what is
said of her majesty’s leaving a prodigious quantity
of jewels and plate behind her, and even
a <i>crowded wardrobe</i>. For so prevalent was
this thrifty humour in the queen’s highness,
that she could not persuade herself to part
with so much, as a cast-gown to any of her servants<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>You allow yourself to be very gay, replied
Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, on this foible of the great
queen. But one thing you forget, that it
never biased her judgment so far as to prevent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
a fit choice of her servants on all occasions<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>.
And, as to her wary management of the public
revenue, which you take a pleasure to exaggerate,
this, methinks, is a venial fault in a prince,
who could not, in her circumstances; have provided
for the expences of government, but by
the nicest and most attentive economy.</p>

<p>I understand, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, the full
force of that consideration; and believe it was
that <i>attention</i> principally, which occasioned
the popularity of her reign, and the high esteem,
in which the wisdom of her government
is held to this day. The bulk of her subjects
were, no doubt, highly pleased to find themselves
spared on all occasions of expence. And
it served at the same time, to gratify their natural
envy of the great, to find, that <i>their</i> fortunes
were first and principally sacrificed to
the public service. Nay, I am not sure that
the very rapacity of her nature, in the sale of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
her offices, was any objection with the people
at large, or even the lower gentry of the kingdom.
For these, having no pretensions themselves
to those offices, would be well enough
pleased to see them not <i>bestowed</i> on their
betters, but dearly purchased by them. And
then this traffic at court furnished the inferior
gentry with a pretence for making the most of
their magistracies. This practice at least must
have been very notorious amongst them, when
a facetious member of the lower house could
define a justice of peace to be, “A living creature,
that for half a dozen of chickens, will
dispense with a whole dozen of penal statutes<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>.”
But, however this be, the queen’s ends, in
every view, were abundantly answered. She
enriched herself: she gained the affections of
the people, and depressed and weakened the
nobility. And by all these ways she effectually
provided for, what she had ever most
at heart, her own supreme and uncontrolled
authority.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p>And is that to be wondered at in a great
prince? returned Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>. Or, to take
the matter in the light you place it, what if the
queen had so much of her sex<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> and family in
her disposition, as to like well enough to have
her own way, is this such a crime as you would
make of it? If she loved power, it was not to
make a wanton or oppressive use of it. And
if all princes knew as well to bound their own
wills, as she did, we should not much complain
of their impatience to be under the control of
their subjects.</p>

<p>I am sorry, said Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, that the acts
of her reign will not allow me to come into
this opinion of her moderation. On the other
hand, her government appears to me, in many
instances, <small>OPPRESSIVE</small>, and highly prejudicial
to the ancient rights and privileges of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
people. For what other construction can we
make of her frequent interposition to restrain
the counsels of their representatives in parliament:
threatening some, imprisoning others,
and silencing all with the thunder of her prerogative?
Or, when she had suffered their
counsels to ripen into bills, what shall we say
of her high and mighty rejection of them, and
that not in single and extraordinary cases, but
in matters of ordinary course, and by dozens?
I pass by other instances. But was her <i>moderation</i>
seen in dilapidating the revenues of the
church; of that church, which she took under
the wing of her supremacy, and would be
thought to have sheltered from all its enemies<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>.
The honest archbishop <span class="smcap">Parker</span>, I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
heard, ventured to remonstrate against this
abuse, the cognizance of which came so directly
within his province. But to what effect, may
be gathered, not only from the continuance of
these depredations, but her severe reprehension
of another of her bishops, whom she
threatened with an oath to <small>UNFROCK</small>&mdash;that
was her majesty’s own word&mdash;if he did not
immediately give way to her princely extortions.</p>

<p>It may be hardly worth while to take notice
of smaller matters. But who does not resent
her capricious tyranny, in disgracing such of
her servants as presumed to deviate, on any
pretence, from her good pleasure; nay, such
as gave an implicit obedience to her will, if it
stood with her interest to disgrace them? Something,
I know, may be said to excuse the proceedings
against the queen of <i>Scots</i>. But the
fate of <span class="smcap">Davison</span> will reflect eternal dishonour
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
on the policy, with which that measure was
conducted.</p>

<p>I run over these things hastily, continued
Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span>, and in no great order: but you
will see what to conclude from these hints;
which taken together, I believe, may furnish a
proper answer to the most considerable parts
of your apology.</p>

<p>To sum it up in few words. Those two great
events of her time, <span class="smcap">the establishment of
the Reformation</span>, and <span class="smcap">the triumph over
the power of Spain</span>, cast an uncommon lustre
on the reign of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>. Posterity, dazzled
with these obvious successes, went into an excessive
admiration of her personal virtues. And
what has served to brighten them the more, is
the place in which we chance to find her,
between the bigot queen on the one hand, and
the pedant king on the other. No wonder then
that, on the first glance, her government should
appear able, and even glorious. Yet, in looking
into particulars, we find that much is to be
attributed to fortune, as well as skill; and that
her glory is even lessened by considerations,
which, on a careless view, may seem to augment
it. The difficulties, she had to encounter,
were great. Yet these very difficulties, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
themselves, created the proper means to surmount
them. They sharpened the wits, inflamed
the spirits, and united the affections, of
a whole people. The name of her great enemy
on the continent, at that time, carried terror
with it. Yet his power was, in reality, much
less than it appeared. The <i>Spanish</i> empire was
corrupt and weak, and tottered under its own
weight. But this was a secret even to the <i>Spaniard</i>
himself. In the mean time, the confidence,
which the opinion of great strength
inspires, was a favourable circumstance. It occasioned
a remissness and neglect of counsel on
one side, in proportion as it raised the utmost
vigilance and circumspection on the other. But
this was not all. The religious feuds in the
Low Countries&mdash;the civil wars in <i>France</i>&mdash;the
distractions of <i>Scotland</i>&mdash;all concurred to
advance the fortunes of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>. Yet all
had, perhaps, been too little in that grand crisis
of her fate, and, as it fell out, of her glory, if
the conspiring elements themselves had not
fought for her.</p>

<p>Such is the natural account of her foreign
triumphs. Her domestic successes admit as
easy a solution. Those external dangers themselves,
the genius of the time, the state of religious
parties, nay, the very factions of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
court, all of them directly, or by the slightest
application of her policy, administered to her
greatness. Such was the condition of the times,
that it forced her to assume the resemblance, at
least, of some popular <i>virtues</i>: and so singular
her fortune, that her very <i>vices</i> became as respectable,
perhaps more useful to her reputation,
than her virtues. She was vigilant in her
counsels; careful in the choice of her servants;
courteous and condescending to her subjects.
She appeared to have an extreme tenderness
for the interests, and an extreme zeal for the
honour, of the nation. This was the bright
side of her character; and it shone the brighter
from the constant and imminent dangers, to
which she was exposed. On the other hand,
she was choleric, and imperious; jealous, timid,
and avaricious: oppressive, as far as she durst;
in many cases capricious, in some tyrannical.
Yet these vices, some of them sharpened and
refined her policy, and the rest, operating
chiefly towards her courtiers and dependents,
strengthened her authority, and rooted her
more firmly in the hearts of the people. The
mingled splendour of these qualities, good and
bad (for even her worst had the luck, when
seen but on one side, or in well-disposed lights
to look like good ones) so far dazzled the eyes
of all, that they did not, or would not, see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
many outrageous acts of tyranny and oppression.</p>

<p>And thus it hath come to pass that, with
some ability, more cunning, and little real
virtue, the name of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> is, by the concurrence
of many accidental causes, become
the most revered of any in the long roll of our
princes. How little she merited this honour,
may appear from this slight sketch of her character
and government. Yet, when all proper
abatement is made in both, I will not deny her
to have been a great, that is, a <i>fortunate</i>,
queen; in this, perhaps, the most fortunate,
that she has attained to so unrivalled a glory
with so few pretensions to deserve it.</p>

<p>And so, replied Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>, you have
concluded your invective in full form, and
rounded it, as the ancient orators used to do,
with all the advantage of a peroration. But,
setting aside this trick of eloquence, which is
apt indeed to confound a plain man, unused to
such artifices, I see not but you have left the
argument much as you took it up; and that I
may still have leave to retain my former reverence
for the good old times of queen <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.
It is true, she had some foibles. You
have spared, I believe, none of them. But, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
make amends for these defects, let but the
history of her reign speak for her, I mean in its
own artless language, neither corrupted by flattery,
nor tortured by invidious glosses; and
we must ever conceive of her, I will not say as
the most faultless, perhaps not the most virtuous,
but surely the most able, and, from the
splendour of some leading qualities, the most
glorious of our <i>English</i> monarchs.</p>

<p>To give you my notion of her in few Words.&mdash;For
the dispute, I find, must end, as most
others usually do, in the simple representation
of our own notions.&mdash;She was discreet, frugal,
provident, and sagacious; intent on the pursuit
of her great ends, <i>the establishment of religion</i>,
and <i>the security and honour of her people</i>: prudent
in the choice of the best <i>means</i> to effect
them, the employment of able servants, and the
management of the public revenue; dexterous at
improving all advantages which her own wisdom
or the circumstances of the times gave her: fearless
and intrepid in the execution of great designs,
yet careful to unite the deepest foresight with her
magnanimity. If she seemed <small>AVARICIOUS</small>, let
it be considered that the nicest frugality was
but necessary in her situation: if <small>IMPERIOUS</small>,
that a female government needed to be made
respectable by a shew of authority: and if at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
any time <small>OPPRESSIVE</small>, that the <i>English</i> constitution,
as it then stood, as well as her own
nature, had a good deal of that bias.</p>

<p>In a word, let it be remembered, that she
had the honour of ruling<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>, perhaps of forming,
the wisest, the bravest, the most, virtuous
people, that have adorned any age or country;
and that she advanced the glory of the <i>English</i>
name and that of her own dignity to a height,
which has no parallel in the annals of our nation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Digby</span>, who had been very attentive to
the course of this debate, was a little disappointed
with the conclusion of it. He thought
to have settled his judgment of this reign by
the information his two friends should afford
him. But he found himself rather perplexed
by their altercations, than convinced by them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
He owned, however, the pleasure they had
given him; and said, he had profited so much
at least by the occasion, that, for the future,
he should conceive with something less reverence
of the great queen, and should proceed
with less prejudice to form his opinion of her
character and administration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> did not appear quite satisfied
with this sceptical conclusion; and was going
to enforce some things, which he thought had
been touched too slightly, when Dr. <span class="smcap">Arbuthnot</span>
took notice that their walk was now at an
end; the path, they had taken, having by this
time brought them round again to the walls of
the castle. Besides, he said, he found himself
much wearied with this exercise; though the
warmth of debate, and the opportunities he
took of resting himself at times, had kept him
from complaining of it. He proposed, therefore,
getting into the coach as soon as possible;
where, though the conversation was in some
sort resumed, there was nothing material
enough advanced on either side to make it necessary
for me to continue this recital any further.

<h3>SIR JOHN MAYNARD, MR. SOMERS,
BISHOP BURNET<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>.</h3>

<h4>TO DR. TILLOTSON.</h4>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Though</span> the principles of nature and common
sense do fully authorise resistance to the
civil magistrate in extreme cases, and of course
justify the late Revolution to every candid and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
dispassionate man; yet I am sensible, my excellent
friend, there are many prejudices which
hinder the glorious proceedings in that affair
from being seen in their true light. The principal
of them, indeed, are founded on false
systems of policy, and those tied down on the
consciences of men by wrong notions of religion.
And such as these, no doubt, through
the experience of a better government, and a
juster turn of thinking, which may be expected
to prevail in our times, will gradually fall away
of themselves.</p>

<p>But there is another set of notions on this
subject, not so easy to be discredited, and
which are likely to keep their hold on the
minds even of the more sober and considerate
sort of men. For whatever advantage the
cause of liberty may receive from general reasonings
on the origin and nature of civil government,
the greater part of our countrymen
will consider, and perhaps rightly, the inquiry
into the constitution of <i>their</i> own government,
as a question of <small>FACT</small>; that must be tried by
authorities and precedents only; and decided
at last by the evidence of historical testimony,
not by the conclusions of philosophy or political
speculation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

<p>Now, though we are agreed that this way of
managing the controversy must, when fully and
fairly pursued, be much in favour of the new
settlement, yet neither, I think, is it for every
man’s handling, nor is the evidence resulting
from it of a nature to compel our assent. The
argument is formed on a vast variety of particulars,
to be collected only from a large and
intimate acquaintance with the antiquities,
laws, and usages of the kingdom. Our printed
histories are not only very short and imperfect;
but the original records, which the curious
have in their possession, are either so obscure
or so scanty, that a willing adversary hath
always in readiness some objection, or some
cavil at least, to oppose to the evidence that
may be drawn from them. Besides, appearances,
even in the plainest and most unquestioned
parts of our history, are sometimes so
contradictory; arising either from the tyranny
of the prince, the neglect of the people, or
some other circumstance of the times; and, to
crown all, the question itself hath been so involved
by the disputations of prejudiced and
designing men; that the more intelligent inquirer
is almost at a loss to determine for
himself, on which side the force of evidence
lies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<p>On this account I have frequently thought
with myself, that a right good <small>CONSTITUTIONAL
HISTORY</small> of <i>England</i> would be the noblest
service that any man, duly qualified for the
execution of such a work, could render to his
country. For though, as I said, the subject
be obscure in itself, and perplexed by the subtilties
which contending parties have invented
for the support of their several schemes; yet,
from all I have been able to observe in the
course of my own reading, or conversation,
there is little doubt but that the form of the
<i>English</i> government hath, at all times, been
<small>FREE</small>. So that, if such a history were drawn
up with sufficient care out of our authentic
papers and public monuments, it would not
only be matter of entertainment to the curious,
but the greatest security to every <i>Englishman</i>
of his religions and civil rights. For what can
be conceived, more likely to preserve and perpetuate
these rights, than the standing evidence
which such a work would afford, of
the genuine spirit and temper of the constitution?
Of the principles of freedom<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>, on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
which it was formed, and on which it hath
been continually and uniformly conducted?
Our youth, who at present amuse themselves
with little more than the military part of our
annals, would then have an easy opportunity
of seeing to the bottom of all our civil and domestic
broils. They would know on what pretences
the <small>PREROGATIVE</small> of our kings hath
sometimes aspired to exalt itself above controul;
and would learn to revere the magnanimity
of their forefathers, who as constantly
succeeded in their endeavours to reduce it
within the ancient limits and boundaries of the
<small>LAW</small>. In a word, they would no longer rest on
the surface and outside, as it were, of the
<i>English</i> affairs, but would penetrate the interior
parts of our constitution; and furnish
themselves with a competent degree of civil and
political wisdom; the most solid fruit that can
be gathered from the knowledge and experience
of past times.</p>

<p>And I am ready to think that such a provision
as this, for the instruction of the <i>English</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
youth, may be the more requisite, on account
of that limited indeed, yet awful form of government,
under which we live. For, besides the
name, and other ensigns of majesty, in common
with those who wear the most despotic
crown, the whole execution of our laws, and
the active part of government, is in the hands
of the prince. And this pre-eminence gives
him so respectable a figure in the eyes of his
subjects, and presents him so constantly, and
with such lustre of authority, to their minds,
that it is no wonder they are sometimes disposed
to advance him, from the rank of first
magistrate of a free people, into that of supreme
and sole arbiter of the laws.</p>

<p>So that, unless these prejudices are corrected
by the knowledge of our constitutional history,
there is constant reason to apprehend, not only
that the royal authority may stretch itself
beyond due bounds; but may grow, at length,
into that enormous tyranny, from which this
nation hath been at other times so happily, and
now of late so wonderfully, redeemed.</p>

<p>But I suffer myself to be carried by these reflexions
much further than I designed. I would
only say to you, that, having sometimes reflected
very seriously on this subject, it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
with the highest pleasure I heard it discoursed
of the other day by two of the most accomplished
lawyers of our age: the venerable Sir
<span class="smcap">John Maynard</span>, who, for a long course of
years, hath maintained the full credit and dignity
of his profession; and Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span>, who,
though a young man, is rising apace, and
with proportionable merits, into all the honours
of it.</p>

<p>I was very attentive, as you may suppose, to
the progress of this remarkable conversation;
and, as I had the honour to bear a full share in
it myself, I may the rather undertake to give
you a particular account of it. I know the
pleasure it will give you to see a subject, you
have much at heart, and which we have frequently
talked over in the late times, thoroughly,
canvassed, and cleared up; as I think it must
be, to your entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was within a day or two after that great
event, so pleasing to all true <i>Englishmen</i>, <small>THE
CORONATION OF THEIR MAJESTIES</small><a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>, that Mr.
<span class="smcap">Somers</span> and I went; as we sometimes used, to
pass an evening with our excellent friend, my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Lord Commissioner<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>. I shall not need to attempt
his character to you, who know him so
well. It is enough to say, that his faculties
and spirits are, even in this maturity of age, in
great vigour. And it seems as if this joyful
Revolution, so agreeable to his hopes and principles,
had given a fresh spring and elasticity to
both.</p>

<p>The conversation of course turned on the
late august ceremony; the mention of which
awakened a sort of rapture in the good old
man, which made him overflow in his meditations
upon it. Seeing us in admiration of the
zeal which transported him, “Bear with me,
said he, my young friends. Age, you know,
hath its privilege. And it may be, I use it
somewhat unreasonably. But I, who have
seen the prize of liberty contending for through
half a century, to find it obtained at last by a
method so sure, and yet so unexpected, do
you think it possible that I should contain
myself on such an occasion? Oh, if ye had
lived with me in those days, when such mighty
struggles were made for public freedom, when
so many wise counsels miscarried, and so many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
generous enterprises concluded but in the confirmation
of lawless tyranny; if, I say, ye had
lived in those days, and now at length were able
to contrast with me, to the tragedies that were
then acted, this safe, this bloodless, this
complete deliverance: I am mistaken, if the
youngest of you could reprove me for this joy,
which makes me think I can never say enough
on so delightful a subject.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>Reprove you, my lord? Alas! we are neither
of us so unexperienced in what hath passed
of late in these kingdoms, as not to rejoice
with you to the utmost for this astonishing deliverance.
You know I might boast of being
among the first that wished for, I will not say
projected, the measures by which it hath been
accomplished. And for Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span>, the church
of <i>England</i> will tell&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I confess, my warmest wishes have ever
gone along with those who conducted this noble
enterprise. And I pretend to as sincere a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
pleasure as any man, in the completion of it.
Yet, if we were not unreasonable at such a
time, I might be tempted to mention one circumstance,
which, I know not how, a little
abates the joy of these triumphant gratulations.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>Is not the settlement then to your mind? Or
hath any precaution been neglected, which you
think necessary for the more effectual security
of our liberties?</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>Not that. I think the provision for the
people’s right as ample as needs be desired.
Or, if any further restrictions on the crown be
thought proper, it will now be easy for the
people, in a regular parliamentary way, to effect
it. What I mean is a consideration of much
more importance.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>The pretended prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span>, you think,
will be raising some disturbance, or alarm at
least, to the new government. I believe, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
may take upon me to give you perfect satisfaction
upon that subject<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>Still your conjectures fall short or wide of
my meaning. Our new <span class="smcap">Magna Charta</span>, as
I love to call the <i>Declaration of Rights</i>, seems
a sufficient barrier against any future encroachments
of the <small>CROWN</small>. And I think, the pretended
prince of <span class="smcap">Wales</span>, whatever be determined
of his birth, a mere phantom, that may
amuse, and perhaps disquiet, the weaker sort
for a while; but, if left to itself<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>, will soon
vanish out of the minds of the <small>PEOPLE</small>. Not
but I allow that even so thin a pretence as this
may, some time or other, be conjured up to
disturb the government. But it must be, when
a certain set of principles are called in aid to
support it. And, to save you the further
trouble of guessing, I shall freely tell you, what
those <i>principles</i> are.&mdash;You will see, in them,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
the ground of my present fears and apprehensions.</p>

<p>It might be imagined that so necessary a
Revolution, as that which hath taken place,
would sufficiently approve itself to all reasonable
men. And it appears, in fact, to have
done so, now that the public injuries are fresh,
and the general resentment of them strong and
lively. But it too often happens, that when
the evil is once removed, it is presently forgotten:
and in matters of government especially,
where the people rarely think till they are
made to feel, when the grievance is taken away,
the false system easily returns, and sometimes
with redoubled force, which had given birth
to it.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>One can readily admit the principles. But
the conclusion, you propose to draw from
them&mdash;</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>This very important one, “That, if the late
change of government was brought about, and
can be defended only, on the principles of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
liberty; the settlement, introduced by it, can
be thought secure no longer than while those
principles are rightly understood, and generally
admitted.”</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>But what reason is there to apprehend that
these principles, so commonly professed and
publickly avowed, will not continue to be kept
up in full vigour?</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>Because, I doubt, they are so commonly
and publickly avowed, only to serve a present
turn; and not because they come from
the heart, or are entertained on any just ground
of conviction.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>Very likely: and considering the pains that
have been taken to possess the minds of men
with other notions of government, the wonder
is, how they came to be entertained at all. Yet
surely the experience of better times may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
expected to do much. Men will of course
think more justly on these subjects in proportion
as they find themselves more happy.
And thus the principles, which, as you say,
were first pretended to out of necessity, will
be followed out of choice, and bound upon
them by the conclusions of their own reason.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I wish your lordship be not too sanguine in
these expectations. It is not to be conceived
how insensible the people are to the blessings
they enjoy, and how easily they forget their
past miseries. So that, if their principles have
not taken deep root, I would not answer for
their continuing much longer than it served
their purpose to make a shew of them.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>I must confess, that all my experience of
mankind inclines me to this opinion. I could
relate to you some strange instances of the sort
Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span> hints at. But after all, Sir, you
do not indulge these apprehensions, on account
of the general fickleness of human nature. You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
have some more particular reasons for concluding
that the system of liberty, which hath
worked such wonders of late, is not likely to
maintain its ground amongst us.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I have: and I was going to explain those
reasons, if my lord of <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span> had not a
little diverted me from the pursuit of them.</p>

<p>It is very notorious from the common discourse
of men even on this great occasion (and
I wish it had not appeared too evidently in the
debates of the houses), that very many of us
have but crude notions of the form of government
under which we live, and which hath
been transmitted to us from our forefathers. I
have met with persons of no mean rank, and
supposed to be well seen in the history of the
kingdom, who speak a very strange language.
They allow, indeed, that something was to be
done in the perilous circumstances into which
we had fallen. But, when they come to explain
themselves, it is in a way that leaves us
no <i>right</i> to do any thing; at least, not what it
was found expedient for the nation to do at
this juncture. For they contend in so many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
words, “that the crown of <i>England is absolute</i>;
that the form of government is an <i>entire
and simple monarchy</i>; and that so it hath
continued to be in every period of it down to
the Abdication: that the <span class="smcap">Conquest</span>, at least,
to ascend no higher, invested the <span class="smcap">first William</span>
in absolute dominion; that from him it
devolved of course upon his successors; and
that all the pretended rights of the people, the
<span class="smcap">Great Charters</span> of ancient and modern date,
were mere usurpations on the prince, extorted
from him by the necessity of his affairs, and
revocable at his pleasure: nay, they insinuate
that parliaments themselves were the creatures
of his will; that their privileges were all derived
from the sovereign’s grant; and that they
made no part in the original frame and texture
of the <i>English</i> government.</p>

<p>In support of this extraordinary system, they
refer us to the constant tenor of our history.
They speak of the Conqueror, as proprietary
of the whole kingdom: which accordingly,
they say, he parcelled out, as he saw fit, in
grants to his <i>Norman</i> and <i>English</i> subjects:
that, through his partial consideration of the
church, and an excessive liberality to his favoured
servants, this distribution was so ill
made, as to give occasion to all the broils and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
contentions that followed: that the churchmen
began their unnatural claim of independency
on the crown; in which attempt they
were soon followed by the encroaching and too
powerful barons: that, in these struggles, many
flowers of the crown were rudely torn from it,
till a sort of truce was made, and the rebellious
humour somewhat composed, by the extorted
articles of <span class="smcap">Running-mede</span>: that these confusions,
however, were afterwards renewed, and
even increased, by the contests of the two
houses of <span class="smcap">York</span> and <span class="smcap">Lancaster</span>: but that,
upon the union of the roses in the person of
<span class="smcap">Henry VII</span>, these commotions were finally
appeased, and the crown restored to its ancient
dignity and lustre: that, indeed, the usage of
parliaments, with some other forms of popular
administration, which had been permitted in
the former irregular reigns, was continued; but
of the mere grace of the prince, and without
any consequence to his prerogative: that succeeding
kings, and even <span class="smcap">Henry</span> himself, considered
themselves as possessed of an imperial
crown; and that, though they might sometimes
condescend to take the advice, they were
absolutely above the control, of the people: in
short, that the law itself was but the will of the
prince, declared in parliament; or rather solemnly
received and attested there, for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
better information and more entire obedience
of the subject.</p>

<p>This they deliver as a just and fair account
of the <i>English</i> government; the genius of
which, they say, is absolute and despotic in
the highest degree; as much so, at least, as
that of any other monarchy in <i>Europe</i>. They
ask, with an air of insult, what restraint our
<span class="smcap">Henry VIII</span>, and our admired <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>,
would ever suffer to be put on their prerogative;
and they mention with derision the fancy
of dating the high pretensions of the crown
from the accession of the <span class="smcap">Stuart</span> family. They
affirm, that <span class="smcap">James I</span>, and his son, aimed only
to continue the government on the footing on
which they had received it; that their notions
of it were authorized by constant fact; by
the evidence of our histories; by the language
of parliaments; by the concurrent sense of
every order of men amongst us: and that what
followed in the middle of this century was the
mere effect of <small>POPULAR</small>, as many former disorders
had been of <small>PATRICIAN</small>, violence. In a
word, they conclude with saying, that the old
government revived again at the <span class="smcap">Restoration</span>,
just as, in like circumstances, it had done before
at the <small>UNION</small> of the two houses: that, in
truth, the voluntary desertion of the late king
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
have given a colour to the innovation of the
present year; but that, till this new settlement
was made, the <i>English</i> constitution, as implying
something different from pure monarchy,
was an unintelligible notion, or rather
a mere whimsy, that had not the least foundation
in truth or history.”</p>

<p>This is a summary of the doctrines, which,
I doubt, are too current amongst us. I do not
speak of the bigoted adherents to the late king;
but of many cooler and more disinterested men,
whose <i>religious</i> principles, as I suppose (for it
appears it could not be their <i>political</i>), had
engaged them to concur in the new settlement.
You will judge, then, if there be not reason
to apprehend much mischief from the prevalence
and propagation of such a system: a system,
which, as being, in the language of the
patrons of it, founded upon <i>fact</i>, is the more
likely to impose upon the people; and, as referring
to the practice of ancient times, is not
for every man’s confutation. I repeat it, therefore;
if this notion of the despotic form of our
government become general, I tremble to think
what effect it may hereafter produce on the
minds of men; especially when joined to that
false tenderness, which the people of <i>England</i>
are so apt to entertain for their princes, even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
the worst of them, under misfortune. I might
further observe, that this prerogative system
hath a direct tendency to produce, as well as
heighten, this compassion to the sovereign.
And I make no scruple to lay it before you
with all its circumstances, because I know to
whom I speak, and that I could not have
wished for a better opportunity of hearing it
confuted.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>I must own, though I was somewhat unwilling
to give way to such melancholy apprehensions
at this time, I think with Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span>,
there is but too much reason to entertain them.
For my own part, I am apt to look no further
for the <i>right</i> of the legislature to settle the government
in their own way, than their own
free votes and resolutions. For, being used to
consider all political power as coming originally
from the people, it seems to me but fitting that
they should dispose of that power for their
own use, in what hands, and under what conditions,
they please. Yet, as much regard is
due to established forms and ancient prescription,
I think the matter of <i>fact</i> of great consequence;
and, if the people in general should
once conceive of it according to this representation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
I should be very anxious for the issue of so
dangerous an opinion. I must needs, therefore,
join very entirely with Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span>, in
wishing to hear the whole subject canvassed,
or rather finally determined, as it must be, if
Sir <span class="smcap">John Maynard</span> will do us the pleasure to
acquaint us what his sentiments are upon it.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>Truly, my good friends, you have opened a
very notable cause, and in good form. Only,
methinks, a little less solemnity, if you had so
pleased, might have better suited the occasion.
Why, I could almost laugh, to hear you talk
of feats and dangers from a phantom of your
own raising. I certainly believe the common
proverb belies us; and that old age is not that
dastardly thing it hath been represented. For,
instead of being terrified by this conceit of a
prescriptive right in our sovereigns to tyrannize
over the subject, I am ready to think the
contrary so evident from the constant course of
our history, that the simplest of the people
are in no hazard of falling into the delusion. I
should rather have apprehended mischief from
other quarters; from the influence of certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
speculative points, which have been to successfully
propagated of late; and chiefly from
those pernicious glosses, which too many of
my order have made on the letter or the law,
and too many of yours, my lord of <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>,
on that of the gospel. Trust me, if the matter
once came to a question of <small>FACT</small>, and the inquiry
be only concerning ancient form and
precedent, the decision will be in our favour.
And for yourselves, I assure myself, this decision
is already made. But since you are
willing to put me upon the task, and we have
leisure enough for such an amusement, I shall
very readily undertake it. And the rather, as
I have more than once in my life had occasion
to go to the bottom of this inquiry; and now
very lately have taken a pleasure to reflect on
the general evidence which history affords of
our free constitution, and to review the scattered
hints and passages I had formerly set down for
my private satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I understand the question to be, not
under what <i>form</i> the government hath appeared
at some particular conjunctures, but
what we may conclude it to have been from
the general current and tenor of our histories.
More particularly, I conceive, you would ask,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
not whether the <i>administration</i> hath not at
some seasons been <small>DESPOTIC</small>, but whether the
<i>genius</i> of the government hath not at all times
been <small>FREE</small>. Or, if you do not think the
terms, in which I propose the question, strict
enough, you will do well to state it in your
own way, that hereafter we may have no dispute
about it.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>I suppose, the question, as here put, is determinate
enough for our purpose.&mdash;Or, have
you, Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span>, any exceptions to make to
it?</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I believe we understand each other perfectly
well; the question being only this, “Whether
there be any ground in history, to conclude
that the prince hath a constitutional claim to
absolute uncontrolable dominion; or, whether
the liberty of the subject be not essential to
every different form, under which the <i>English</i>
government hath appeared?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span></p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>You expect of me then to shew, in opposition
to the scheme just now delivered by you,
that neither from the original constitution of
the government, nor from the various forms
(for they have, indeed, been various) under
which it hath been administered, is there any
reason to infer, that the <i>English</i> monarchy
is, or of right ought to be, despotic and unlimited.</p>

<p>Now this I take to be the easiest of all undertakings;
so very easy, that I could trust a
plain man to determine the matter for himself
by the light that offers itself to him from the
slightest of our histories. ’Tis true, the deeper
his researches go, his conviction will be the
clearer; as any one may see by dipping into
my friend <span class="smcap">Nat. Bacon’s</span> discourses; where our
free constitution is set forth with that evidence,
as must for ever have silenced the patrons of
the other side, if he had not allowed himself
to strain some things beyond what the truth,
or indeed his cause, required. But, saving to
myself the benefit of his elaborate work, I
think it sufficient to take notice, that the system
of liberty is supported even by that short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
sketch of our history, which Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span> hath
laid before us; and in spite of the disguises,
with which, as he tells us, the enemies of
liberty have endeavoured to cloak it.</p>

<p>You do not, I am sure, expect from me,
that I should go back to the elder and more
remote parts of our history; that I should take
upon me to investigate the scheme of government,
which hath prevailed in this kingdom
from the time that the <i>Roman</i> power departed
from us; or that I should even lay myself out
in delineating, as many have done, the plan of
the <i>Saxon</i> constitution: though such an attempt
might not be unpleasing, nor altogether
without its use, as the <i>principles</i> of the <i>Saxon</i>
policy, and in some respects the <i>form</i> of it,
have been constantly kept up in every succeeding
period of the <i>English</i> monarchy. I content
myself with observing, that the spirit of
liberty was predominant in those times: and,
for proof of it, appeal at present only to one
single circumstance, which you will think remarkable.
Our <i>Saxon</i> ancestors conceived so
little of government, by the will of the magistrate,
without fixed laws, that <span class="smcap">Laga</span>, or <span class="smcap">Leaga</span>,
which in their language first and properly signified
the same as <span class="smcap">Law</span> with us, was transferred<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
very naturally (for language always
conforms itself to the genius, temper, and manners
of a nation) to signify a country, district,
or province; these good people having no notion
of any inhabited country not governed by
laws. Thus <span class="smcap">D&aelig;na-laga</span>; <span class="smcap">Merkena-laga</span>;
and <span class="smcap">Westsexena-laga</span>, were not only used in
their laws and history to signify the <i>laws</i> of the
<i>Danes</i>, <i>Mercians</i>, and <i>West-Saxons</i>, but the
<i>countries</i> likewise. Of which usage I could
produce to you many instances, if I did not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
presume that, for so small a matter as this, my
mere word might be taken.</p>

<p>You see then how fully the spirit of liberty
possessed the very language of our <i>Saxon</i> forefathers.
And it might well do so; for it was
of the essence of the <i>German</i> constitutions; a
just notion of which (so uniform was the genius
of the brave people that planned them) may be
gathered, you know, from what the <i>Roman</i>
historians, and, above all, from what <span class="smcap">Tacitus</span>
hath recorded of them.</p>

<p>But I forbear so common a topic: and, besides,
I think myself acquitted of this task, by
the prudent method, which the defenders of
the regal power have themselves taken in conducting
this controversy. For, as conscious of
the testimony which the <i>Saxon</i> times are ready
to bear against them, they are wise enough to
lay the foundation of their system in the <span class="smcap">Conquest</span>.
They look, no higher than that event
for the origin of the <i>constitution</i>, and think
they have a notable advantage over us in deducing
their notion of the <i>English</i> government
from the form it took in the hands of the <i>Norman</i>
invader. But is it not pleasant to hear
these men calumniate the improvements that
have been made from time to time in the plan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
of our civil constitution with the name of <i>usurpations</i>,
when they are not ashamed to erect the
<i>constitution</i> itself on what <i>they</i> must esteem, at
least, a great and manifest usurpation?</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Conquest</span>, I suppose, in their opinion, gives
<i>right</i>. And since an inquiry into the origin
of a constitution requires that we fix <i>somewhere</i>,
considering the vast alterations introduced by
the Conquest, and that we have never pretended
to reject, but only to improve and complete, the
duke of <span class="smcap">Normandy’s</span> establishment; I believe
it may be as proper to set out from that &aelig;ra
as from any other.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>Your lordship does not imagine that I am
about to excuse myself from closing with them,
even on their own terms. I intended that question
only as a reproach to the persons we have
to deal with; who, when a successful event
makes, or but seems to make, for their idol of
an absolute monarchy, call it a regular establishment:
whereas a revolution brought about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
by the justest means, if the cause of liberty receive
an advantage by it, shall be reviled by the
name of usurpation. But let them employ
what names they please, provided their facts be
well grounded. We will allow them to dignify
the <i>Norman</i> settlement with the title of <small>CONSTITUTION</small>.
What follows? That <i>despotism</i>
was of the essence of that constitution? So they
tell us indeed; but without one word of proof,
for the assertion. For what! do they think the
name of conquest, or even the <i>thing</i>, implies
an absolute unlimited dominion? Have they
forgotten that <span class="smcap">William’s</span> claim to the crown
was, not <i>conquest</i> (though it enabled him to
support his claim), but <i>testamentary succession</i>:
a title very much in the taste of that
time<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>, and extremely reverenced by our <i>Saxon</i>
ancestors? That, even waving this specious
claim, he condescended to accept the crown,
as a free gift; and by his coronation-oath submitted
himself to the same terms of administration,
as his predecessors? And that, in one
word, he confirmed the <i>Saxon</i> laws, at least
before he had been many years in possession of
his new dignity<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>Is there any thing in all this that favours the
notion of his erecting himself, by the sole virtue
of his victory at <i>Hastings</i>, into an absolute
lord of the conquered country? Is it not
certain that he bound himself, as far as oaths
and declarations could bind him, to govern according
to law; that he could neither touch
the honours nor estates of his subjects but by
legal trial; and that even the many forfeitures
in his reign are an evidence of his proceeding
in that method?</p>

<p>Still we are told “of his parcelling out the
whole land, upon his own terms, to his followers;”
and are insulted “with his famous
institution of feudal tenures.” But what if the
<i>former</i> of these assertions be foreign to the
purpose at least, if not false; and the <i>latter</i>
subversive of the very system it is brought to
establish? I think, I have reason for putting
both these questions. For, what if he parcelled
out most, or all, of the lands of <i>England</i> to
his followers? The fact has been much disputed.
But be it, as they pretend, that the
property of all the soil in the kingdom had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
changed hands: What is that to us, who claim
under our <i>Norman</i>, as well as <i>Saxon</i>, ancestors?
For the question, you see, is about the form
of government settled in this nation at the time
of the Conquest. And they argue with us,
from a supposed act of tyranny in the Conqueror,
in order to come at that settlement. The
<i>Saxons</i>, methinks, might be injured, oppressed,
enslaved; and yet the constitution, transmitted
to us through his own <i>Normans</i>, be perfectly
free.</p>

<p>But their <i>other</i> allegation is still more unfortunate.
“He instituted, they say, the feudal
law.” True. But the feudal law, and absolute
dominion, are two things; and, what is more,
perfectly incompatible.</p>

<p>I take upon me to say, that I shall make out
this point in the clearest manner. In the mean
time, it may help us to understand the nature
of the feudal establishment, to consider the
practice of succeeding times. What that was,
our adversaries themselves, if you please, shall
inform us. Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span> hath told their story
very fairly; which yet amounts only to this,
“That, throughout the <i>Norman</i> and <i>Plantagenet</i>
lines, there was one perpetual contest
between the prince and his feudatories for law
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
and liberty:” an evident proof of the light in
which our forefathers regarded the <i>Norman</i> constitution.
In the competition of the two <span class="smcap">Roses</span>,
and perhaps before, they lost sight indeed of
this prize. But no sooner was the public
tranquillity restored, and the contending claims
united in <span class="smcap">Henry VII.</span> than the old spirit revived.
A legal constitution became the constant
object of the people; and, though not
always avowed, was, in effect, as constantly
submitted to by the sovereign.</p>

<p>It may be true, perhaps, that the ability of
<i>one</i> prince<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>, the imperious carriage of <i>another</i><a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>,
and the generous intrigues of a <i>third</i><a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>; but,
above all, the condition of the times, and a sense
of former miseries, kept down the spirit of liberty
for some reigns, or diminished, at least, the
force and vigour of its operations. But a passive
subjection was never acknowledged, certainly
never demanded as a matter of right, till
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span> now and then, and King <span class="smcap">James</span>,
by talking continually in this strain, awakened
the national jealousy; which proved so uneasy
to himself, and, in the end, so fatal to his
family.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span></p>

<p>I cannot allow myself to mention these things
more in detail to you, who have so perfect a
knowledge of them. One thing only I insist
upon, that, without connecting the system of
liberty with that of prerogative in our notion
of the <i>English</i> government, the tenor of our
history is perfectly unintelligible; and that no
consistent account can be given of it, but on
the supposition of a <small>LEGAL LIMITED CONSTITUTION</small>.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>Yet that constitution, it will be thought, was
at least ill defined, which could give occasion to
so many fierce disputes, and those carried on
through so long a tract of time, between the
crown and the subject.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>The fault, if there was one, lay in the original
plan of the constitution itself; as you will
clearly see when I have opened the nature of it,
that is, when I have explained the genius,
views, and consequences of the <small>FEUDAL POLICY</small>.
It must, however, be affirmed, that this policy
was founded in the principles of freedom, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
was, in truth, excellently adapted to an active,
fierce, and military people; such as were all
those to whom these western parts of <i>Europe</i>
have been indebted for their civil constitutions.
But betwixt the burdensome services imposed
on the subject by this tenure, or which it gave
at least the pretence of exacting from him, and
the too great restraint which an unequal and disproportioned
allotment of feuds to the greater
barons laid on the sovereign; but above all, by
narrowing the plan of liberty too much; and,
while it seemed to provide for the dependency of
the prince on one part of his subjects, by leaving
both him and them in a condition to exercise
an arbitrary dominion over all others:
hence it came to pass that the feudal policy
naturally produced the struggles and convulsions,
you spoke of, till it was seen in the end
to be altogether unsuited to the circumstances
of a rich, civilized, and commercial people.
The event was, that the inconveniences, perceived
in this form of government, gradually
made way for the introduction of a better;
which was not, however, so properly a new
form, as the old one amended and set right;
cleared of its mischiefs and inconsistencies, but
conducted on the same principles as the former,
and pursuing the same end, though by different
methods.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>

<p>It is commonly said, “That the feudal tenures
were introduced at the Conquest.” But
how are we to understand this assertion? Certainly,
not as if the whole system of military
services had been created by the Conqueror;
for they were essential to all the <i>Gothic</i> or
<i>German</i> constitutions. We may suppose then,
that they were only new-modelled by this great
prince. And who can doubt that the form,
which was now given to them, would be copied
from that which the <i>Norman</i> had seen established
in his own country? It would be copied
then from the proper <small>FEUDAL FORM</small>; the essence
of which consisted in the perpetuity
of the feud<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>; whereas these military tenures
had been elsewhere temporary only, or revocable
at the will of the lord.</p>

<p>But to enter fully into the idea of the feudal
constitution; to see at what time, and in what
manner, it was introduced: above all, to comprehend
the reasons that occasioned this great
change; it will be convenient to look back to
the estate of <i>France</i>, and especially of <i>Normandy</i>,
where this constitution had, for some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
years, taken place before it was transferred to
us at the Conquest.</p>

<p>Under the first princes of the <i>Carlovingian</i>
line, the lands of <i>France</i> were of two kinds,
<small>ALLODIAL</small>, and <small>BENEFICIARY</small>. The allodial,
were estates of inheritance; the persons possessing
them, were called <span class="smcap">Hommes libres</span>.
The beneficiary, were held by grants from the
crown. The persons holding immediately under
the emperor, were called <span class="smcap">Leudes</span>; the
sub-tenants, <span class="smcap">Vassals</span>.</p>

<p>Further, the allodial lands were alienable, as
well as hereditary. The beneficiary were properly
neither. They were held for life, or a
term of years, at the will of the lord, and reverted
to him on the expiration of the term for
which they were granted.</p>

<p>I do not stay to explain these institutions
minutely. It is of more importance to see the
alterations that were afterwards made in them.
And the <small>FIRST</small> will be thought a strange one.</p>

<p>The possessors of allodial lands, in <i>France</i>,
were desirous to have them changed into <i>tenures</i>.
They who held of the crown <i>in capite</i>
were entitled to some distinctions and privileges,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
which the allodial lords wished to obtain; and
therefore many of them surrendered their lands
to the emperor, and received them again of
him, in the way of <i>tenure</i>. This practice had
taken place occasionally from the earliest times:
but under <span class="smcap">Charles</span> the Bald, it became almost
general; and <i>free-men</i> not only chose to hold
of the emperor, but of other lords. This last
was first allowed, in consequence of a treaty
between the three brothers, after the battle of
<i>Fontenay</i> in 847.</p>

<p>But these <i>free-men</i> were not so ill-advised
as to make their estates precarious, or to accept
a life estate instead of an inheritance. It
was requisite they should hold for a perpetuity.
And this I take to have been the true
origin of hereditary feuds. Most probably, in
those dangerous times, little people could not
be safe without a lord to protect them: and
the price of this protection was the change of
propriety into tenure.</p>

<p>The <small>SECOND</small> change was by a law made under
the same emperor in the year 877, the last of
his reign. It was then enacted, that beneficiary
estates held under the crown should descend
to the sons of the present possessors:
yet not, as I conceive, to the eldest son; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
to him whom the emperor should chuse; nor
did this law affect the estates only, but <i>offices</i>,
which had hitherto been also beneficiary; and
so the sons of counts, marquises, <i>&amp;c.</i> (which
were all names of offices, not titles of honour)
were to succeed to the authority of their fathers,
and to the benefice annexed to it. The new
feuds, created in allodial lands, had, I suppose,
made the emperor’s tenants desirous of
holding on the same terms; and the weakness
of the reigning prince enabled them to succeed
in this first step, which prepared the
way for a revolution of still more importance.
For,</p>

<p>The <small>THIRD</small> change, by which the inheritance
of beneficiary lands and offices was extended to
perpetuity, and the possession rendered almost
independent of the crown, was not, we may
be sure, effected at once, but by degrees. The
family of <span class="smcap">Charlemagne</span> lost the empire: they
resisted with great difficulty the incursions of
the <i>Normans</i>; and, in the year 911, <i>Normandy</i>
was granted to them as an hereditary
fee. The great lords made their advantage of
the public calamities; they defended the king
on what terms they pleased; if not complied
with in their demands, they refused their assistance
in the most critical conjunctures: and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
before the accession of <span class="smcap">Hugh Capet</span>, had entirely
shaken off their dependence on the crown.
For it is, I think, a vulgar mistake to say,
that this great revolution was the effect of
<span class="smcap">Hugh’s</span> policy. On the contrary, the independence
of the nobles, already acquired, was,
as it seems to me, the cause of his success.
The prince had no authority left, but over his
own demesnes; which were less considerable
than the possessions of some of his nobles.
<span class="smcap">Hugh</span> had one of the largest fiefs: and for this
reason, his usurpation added to the power of
the crown, instead of lessening it, as is commonly
imagined. But to bring back the feuds
of the other nobles to their former precarious
condition was a thing impossible: his authority
was partly supported by superior wisdom, and
partly by superior strength, his vassals being
more numerous than those of any other lord.</p>

<p>I cannot tell if these foreigners, when they
adopted the feudal plan, were immediately
aware of all the consequences of it. An hereditary
tenure was, doubtless, a prodigious acquisition;
yet the advantage was something
counter-balanced by the great number of impositions
which the nature of the change
brought with it. These impositions are what,
in respect of the lord, are called his <small>FRUITS</small> of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
tenure; such as <span class="smcap">Wardship</span>, <span class="smcap">Marriage</span>, <span class="smcap">Relief</span>,
and other services: and were the necessary
consequence of the king’s parting with
his arbitrary disposal of these tenures. For
now that the right of inheritance was in the
tenant, it seemed but reasonable, and, without
this provision, the feudal policy could not
have obtained its end, that the prince, in these
several ways, should secure to himself the honour,
safety, and defence, which the very nature
of the constitution implied and intended.
Hence hereditary feuds were very reasonably
clogged with the obligations. I have mentioned;
which, though trifling in comparison with the
disadvantages of a precarious tenure, were
yet at least some check on the independency
acquired. However, these services, which were
due to the king under the new model, were
also due to the tenant in chief from those who
held of him by the like tenure. And so the
barons, or great proprietaries of land, considering
more perhaps the subjection of their
own vassals, than that by which themselves
were bound to their sovereign, reckoned these
burdens as nothing, with respect to what they
had gained by an hereditary succession.</p>

<p>The example of these <i>French</i> feudataries,
we may suppose, would be catching. We accordingly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
find it followed, in due time, in <i>Germany</i>;
where <span class="smcap">Conrad II.</span><a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> granted the like
privilege of <i>successive</i> tenures, and at the
pressing instance of his tenants.</p>

<p>I thought it material to remind you of these
things; because they prove the feudal institution
on the continent to have been favourable
to the cause of liberty; and because it
will abate our wonder to find it so readily accepted
and submitted to here in <i>England</i>.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>The account you have given, and, I dare
say, very truly, of the origin of feuds in <i>France</i>
and <i>Germany</i>, is such as shews them to have
been an extension of the people’s liberty.
There is no question that hereditary alienable
estates have vastly the preference to beneficiary.
But the case, I suspect, was different with us
in <i>England</i>. The great offices of state, indeed,
in this country, as well as in <i>France</i>,
were beneficiary. But, if I do not mistake,
the lands of the <i>English</i>, except only the
church-lands, were all allodial. And I cannot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
think it could be for the benefit of the <i>English</i>
to change their old <i>Saxon</i> possessions, subject
only to the famous triple obligation, for these
new and burdensome tenures.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>Strange as it may appear, we have yet seen
that the <i>French</i> did not scruple to make that
exchange even of their allodial estates. But to
be fair, there was a great difference, as you
well observe, in the circumstances of the two
people. All the lands in <i>England</i> were, I believe,
allodial, in the <i>Saxon</i> times: while a
very considerable proportion of those in <i>France</i>
were beneficiary.</p>

<p>Another difference, also, in the state of the
two countries, is worth observing. In <i>France</i>,
the allodial lands (though considerable in quantity)
were divided into small portions. In
<i>England</i>, they seem to have been in few
hands; the greater part possessed by the King
and his <i>Thanes</i>; some smaller parcels by the
lesser <i>Thanes</i>; and a very little by the <i>Ceorles</i>.
The consequence was, that, though the allodial
proprietors in <i>France</i> were glad to renounce
their property for tenure, in order to secure
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
the protection they much wanted; yet with
us, as you say, there could not be any such inducement
for the innovation. For, the lands
being possessed in large portions by the nobility
and gentry, the allodial lords in <i>England</i>
were too great to stand in need of protection.
Yet from this very circumstance, fairly attended
to, we shall see that the introduction of
the feudal tenures was neither difficult nor unpopular.
The great proprietors of land were,
indeed, too free and powerful, to be bettered
by this change. But their tenants, that is, the
bulk of the people, would be gainers by it.
For these tenants were, I believe, to a man
beneficiaries. The large estates of the <i>Thanes</i>
were granted out in small portions to others,
either for certain quantities of corn or rent, reserved
to the lord, or on condition of stipulated
services. And these grants, of whichever sort
they were, were either at pleasure, or at most
for a limited term. So that, though the proprietors
of land in <i>England</i> were so much superior
to those in <i>France</i>; yet the tenants of
each were much in the same state; that is,
they possessed beneficiary lands on stipulated
conditions.</p>

<p>When, therefore, by right of forfeiture, the
greater part of the lands in <i>England</i> fell, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
they of course would do, into the power of the
king (for they were in few hands, and those
few had either fought at <i>Hastings</i>, or afterwards
rebelled against him), it is easy to see that the
people would not be displeased to find themselves,
instead of beneficiary tenants<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>, feudatary
proprietors.</p>

<p>I say this on supposition that these great forfeited
estates and signiories, so bountifully bestowed
by the Conqueror on his favourite <i>Normans</i>,
were afterwards, many of them at least,
granted out in smaller parcels to <i>English</i> sub-tenants.
But if these sub-tenants were also
<i>Normans</i> (though the case of the <i>English</i> or
old <i>Saxon</i> freeholders was then very hard), the
change of allodial into feudatary estates is the
more easily accounted for.</p>

<p>The main difficulty would be with the churchmen;
who (though the greatest, and most of
them were, perhaps, <i>Normans</i> too) were well
acquainted with the <i>Saxon</i> laws, and for special
reasons were much devoted to them. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
were sensible that their possessions had been
held, in the <i>Saxon</i> times, in <span class="smcap">Franc-almoign</span>:
a sort of tenure, they were not forward to give
up for this of <i>feuds</i>. ’Tis true, the burdens of
these tenures would, many of them, not affect
them. But then neither could they reap the
principal fruit of them, the fruit of inheritance.
They, besides, considered every restraint on
their privileges as impious; and took the subjection
of the ecclesiastic to the secular power,
which the feudal establishment was to introduce,
for the vilest of all servitudes. Hence
the churchmen were, of all others, the most
averse from this law<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>. And their opposition
might have given the Conqueror still more
trouble, if the suppression of the great Northern
rebellion had not furnished him with the power,
and (as many of them had been deeply engaged
in it) with the pretence, to force it upon them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
And thus, in the end, it prevailed universally,
and without exception.</p>

<p>I would not go further into the history of
these tenures. It may appear from the little I
have said of them, that the feudal system was
rather improved and corrected by the duke of
<span class="smcap">Normandy</span>, than originally planted by him in
this kingdom: that the alteration made in it
was favourable to the public interest; and that
our <i>Saxon</i> liberties were not so properly restrained,
as extended by it. It is of little moment
to inquire whether the nation was won, or
forced, to a compliance with this system. It
is enough to say, that, as it was accepted by
the nation, so it was in itself no servile establishment,
but essentially founded in the principles
of liberty. The duties of lord and feudatary
were reciprocal and acknowledged: services
on the one part, and protection on the
other. The institution was plainly calculated
for the joint-interest<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> of both parties, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
benefit of the community; the proper notion
of the feudal system being that “of a confederacy
between a number of military persons,
agreeing on a certain limited subordination and
dependence on their chief, for the more effectual
defence of his and their lives, territories,
and possessions.”</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I have nothing to object to your account of
the feudal constitution. And I think you do
perfectly right, to lay the main stress on the
general nature and genius of it; as by this
means you cut off those fruitless altercations,
which have been raised, concerning the personal
character of the <i>Norman</i> Conqueror. Our
concern is not with him, but with the government
he established. And if that be free, no
matter whether the founder of it were a tyrant.
But, though I approve your method, I doubt
there is some defect in your argument. <i>Freedom</i>
is a term of much latitude. The <i>Norman</i>
constitution may be free in one sense, as it excludes
the sole arbitrary dominion of one man;
and yet servile enough in another, as it leaves
the government in few hands. For it follows,
from what I understand of the feudal plan, that
though its genius be indeed averse from absolute
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
monarchy, yet it is indulgent enough to
absolute <i>aristocracy</i>. And the notion of each
is equally remote from what we conceive of true
<i>English</i> liberty.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>It is true, the proper feudal form, especially
as established in this kingdom, was in a high
degree oligarchical. It would not otherwise,
perhaps, have suited to the condition of those
military ages. Yet the principles it went upon,
were those of public liberty, and generous
enough to give room for the extension of the
system itself, when a change of circumstances
should require it.&mdash;But your objection will best
be answered by looking a little more distinctly
into the nature of these tenures.</p>

<p>I took notice that the feudal system subjected
the <small>CHURCH</small> more immediately to the civil
power: and laid the foundation of many services
and fruits of tenure to which the <small>LAY-FEUDATARIES</small>
in the <i>Saxon</i> times had been altogether
strangers. It is probable that all the
consequences of this alteration were not foreseen.
Yet the churchmen were pretty quick-sighted.
And the dislike, they had conceived
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
of the new establishment, was the occasion of
those struggles, which continued so long
between the mitre and crown, and which are
so famous more especially in the early parts of
our history. The cause of these ecclesiastics
was a bad one. For their aim was, as is rightly
observed by the advocates for the prerogative,
to assert an independency on the state; and for
that purpose the pope was made a party in the
dispute; by whose intrigues it was kept up in
one shape or other till the total renunciation
of the papal power. Thus far, however, the
feudal constitution cannot be blamed. On the
contrary, it was highly serviceable to the cause
of liberty, as tending only to hold the ecclesiastic,
in a due subordination to the civil,
authority.</p>

<p>The same thing cannot be said of the other
instance, I mean the <i>fruits of tenure</i>, to which
the lay-fees were subjected by this system. For
however reasonable, or rather necessary, those
<i>fruits</i> might be, in a feudal sense, and for the
end to which the feudal establishment was directed,
yet, as the <i>measure</i> of these fruits, as
well as the manner of exacting them, was in a
good degree arbitrary, and too much left to
the discretion of the sovereign, the practice, in
this respect, was soon found by the tenants in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
chief to be an intolerable grievance. Hence
that other contest, so memorable in our history,
betwixt the king and his barons: in which
the former, under the colour of maintaining
his feudal rights, laboured to usurp an absolute
dominion over the persons and properties of his
vassals; and the latter, impatient of the feudal
burdens, or rather of the king’s arbitrary exactions
under pretence of them, endeavoured to
redeem themselves from so manifest an oppression.</p>

<p>It is not to be denied, that, in the heat of
this contest, the barons sometimes carried their
pretensions still further, and laboured in their
turn to usurp on the crown, in revenge for the
oppressions they had felt from it. However,
their first contentions were only for a mitigation
of the feudal system. It was not the character
of the <i>Norman</i> princes to come easily
into any project that was likely to give the least
check to their pretensions. Yet the grievances,
complained of, were in part removed, in part
moderated, by <span class="smcap">Henry</span> the First’s and many
other successive charters: though the last blow
was not given to these feudal servitudes till
after the Restoration, when such of them as
remained, and were found prejudicial to the
liberty of the subject, were finally abolished.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span></p>

<p>Thus we see that <small>ONE</small> essential defect in the
feudal policy, considered not as a military, but
civil institution, was, the too great power it gave
the sovereign in the arbitrary impositions, implied
in this tenure. <span class="smcap">Another</span> was accidental.
It arose from the disproportionate allotment of
those feuds, which gave the greater barons an
ascendant over the prince, and was equally unfavourable
to the cause of liberty. For the
bounty of the duke of <span class="smcap">Normandy</span>, in his distribution
of the forfeited estates and signiories
to his principal officers, had been so immense<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>,
that their share of influence in the state was
excessive, and intrenched too much on the independency
of the crown and the freedom of
the people. And this undue poize in the constitution,
as well as the tyranny of our kings,
occasioned the long continuance of those civil
wars, which for many ages harrassed and distressed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
the nation. The evil, however, in the
end, brought on its own remedy. For these
princely houses being much weakened in the
course of the quarrel, <span class="smcap">Henry VII.</span> succeeded,
at length, to the peaceable possession of the
crown. And by the policy of this prince,
and that of his successor, the barons were
brought so low as to be quite disabled from
giving any disturbance to the crown for the future.</p>

<p>It appears then that <small>TWO</small> great defects in the
feudal plan of government, as settled amongst
us, were, at length, taken away. But a <small>THIRD</small>,
and the greatest defect of all, was the narrowness
of the plan itself, I mean when considered
as a system of <small>CIVIL</small> polity; for, in its primary
martial intention, it was perfectly unexceptionable.</p>

<p>To explain this matter, which is of the
highest importance, and will furnish a direct
answer to Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers’</span> objection, we are to
remember that in the old feudal policy the
king’s barons, that is, such as held <i>in capite</i>
of the crown by barony or knight’s service,
were the king’s, or rather the kingdom’s, great
council. No public concerns could be regularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
transacted, without their consent<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>; though
the lesser barons, or tenants by knight’s service,
did not indeed so constantly appear in
the king’s court, as the greater barons; and
though the public business was sometimes even
left to the ordinary attendants on the king,
most of them churchmen. It appears that,
towards the end of the Conqueror’s reign, the
number of these tenants in chief was about
700; who, as the whole property of the kingdom
was, in effect, in their power, may be
thought a no unfit representative (though this
be no proper <i>feudal</i> idea) of the whole nation.
It was so, perhaps, in those rude and warlike
times, when the strength of the nation lay entirely
in the soldiery; that is, in those who
held by military services, either immediately
of the crown, or of the mesne lords. For the
remainder of the people, whom they called
tenants in socage, were of small account; being
considered only in the light of servants, and
contributing no otherwise to the national support
than by their cultivation of the soil, which
left their masters at leisure to attend with less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
distraction on their military services. At least,
it was perfectly in the genius of the feudal,
that is, military constitutions, to have little regard
for any but the men of arms; and, as
every other occupation would of course be accounted
base and ignoble, it is not to be wondered
that such a difference was made between
the condition of <i>pr&aelig;dial</i> and <i>military</i> tenures.</p>

<p>However, a policy, that excluded such numbers
from the rank and privileges of citizens,
was so far a defective one. And this defect
would become more sensible every day, in proportion
to the growth of arts, the augmentation
of commerce, and the security the nation
found itself in from foreign dangers. The ancient
military establishment would now be
thought unjust, when the exclusive privileges
of the swordsmen were no longer supported by
the necessities of the public, and when the
wealth of the nation made so great a part of
the force of it. Hence arose an important
change in the legislature of the kingdom, which
was much enlarged beyond its former limits.
But this was done gradually; and was more
properly an extension than violation of the ancient
system.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span></p>

<p>First, the number of tenants in chief, or the
king’s freeholders, was much increased by various
causes, but chiefly by the alienation which
the greater barons made of their fees. Such
alienation, though under some restraint, seems
to have been generally permitted in the <i>Norman</i>
feuds; I mean, till <span class="smcap">Magna Charta</span> and
some subsequent statutes laid it under particular
limitations. But, whether the practice were
regular or not, it certainly prevailed from the
earliest times; especially on some more extraordinary
occasions. Thus, when the fashionable
madness of the <span class="smcap">Croisades</span> had involved
the greater barons in immense debts, in order
to discharge the expences of these expeditions,
they alienated their fees, and even dismembered
them; that is, they parted with their right in
them, and made them over in small parcels to
others, to hold of the superior lord. And what
these barons did from necessity, the crown itself
did, out of policy: for the <i>Norman</i> princes,
growing sensible of the inconvenience of making
their vassals too great, disposed of such estates
of their barons as fell in to them by forfeiture,
and were not a few, in the same manner. The
consequence of all this was, that, in process of
time, the lesser military tenants <i>in capite</i> multiplied
exceedingly. And, as many of them
were poor, and unequal to a personal attendance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
in the court of their lord, or in the common
council of the kingdom (where of right and
duty they were to pay their attendance), they
were willing, and it was found convenient to
give them leave, to appear in the way of <i>representation</i>.
And this was the origin of what we
now call <span class="smcap">the Knights of the Shires</span>; who,
in those times, were appointed to represent, not
all the free-holders of counties, but the lesser
tenants of the crown only. For these not attending
in person, would otherwise have had
no place in the king’s council.</p>

<p>The rise of <span class="smcap">Citizens and Burgesses</span>, that
is, representatives of the cities and trading
towns, must be accounted for somewhat differently.
These had originally been in the jurisdiction,
and made part of the demesnes, of
the king and his great lords. The reason of
which appears from what I observed of the
genius of the feudal policy. For, little account
being had of any but martial men, and trade
being not only dishonourable, but almost unknown
in those ages; the lower people, who
lived together in towns, most of them small
and inconsiderable, were left in a state of subjection
to the crown, or some other of the barons,
and exposed to their arbitrary impositions
and talliages.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>

<p>But this condition of burghers, as it sprang
from the military genius of the nation, could
only be supported by it. When that declined
therefore, and, instead of a people of soldiers,
the commercial spirit prevailed, and filled our
towns with rich traders and merchants, it was
no longer reasonable, nor was it the interest of
the crown, that these communities and bodies
of men should be so little regarded. On the
contrary, a large share of the public burdens
being laid upon them, and the frequent necessities
of the crown, especially in foreign wars,
or in the king’s contentions with his barons,
requiring him to have recourse to their purses,
it was naturally brought about that those, as
well as the tenants <i>in capite</i>, should, in time,
be admitted to have a share in the public
councils.</p>

<p>I do not stay to trace the steps of this change.
It is enough to say, that arose insensibly
and naturally out of the growing wealth and
consequence of the trading towns; the convenience
the king found in drawing considerable
sums from them, with greater ease to
himself, and less offence to the people; and,
perhaps, from the view of lessening by their
means the exorbitant power and influence of
the barons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

<p>From these, or the like reasons, the great
towns and cities, that before were royal demesnes,
part of the king’s private patrimony,
and talliable by him at pleasure, were allowed
to appear in his council by their deputies, to
treat with him of the proportion of taxes to be
raised on them, and, in a word, to be considered
it the same light as the other members
of that great assembly.</p>

<p>I do not inquire when this great alteration
was first made. I find it subsisting at least
under <span class="smcap">Edward III.</span> And from that time, there
is no dispute but that the legislature, which
was originally composed of the sovereign and
his feudal tenants, included also the representatives
of the counties, and of the royal towns
and cities. To speak in our modern style, the
<span class="smcap">House of Commons</span> was, now, formed. And
by this addition, the glorious edifice of <i>English</i>
liberty was completed.</p>

<p>I am sensible, I must have wearied you with
this deduction, which can be no secret to either
of you. But it was of importance to shew,
that the constitution of <i>England</i>, as laid in the
feudal tenures, was essentially free; and that
the very changes it hath undergone, were the
natural and almost unavoidable effects of those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
tenures. So that what the adversaries of liberty
object to us, as usurpations on the regal prerogative,
are now seen to be either the proper
result of the feudal establishment, or the most
just and necessary amendments of it.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>I have waited with much pleasure for this
conclusion, which entirely discredits the notion
of an absolute, despotic government. I will
not take upon me to answer for Mr. <i>Somers</i>,
whose great knowledge in the laws and history
of the kingdom enables him to see further into
the subject than I do; but to me nothing appears
more natural or probable than this account
of the rise and progress of the <i>English</i>
monarchy. One difficulty, in particular, which
seemed to embarrass this inquiry, you have
entirely removed, by shewing how, from the
aristocratical form which prevailed in the earlier
times, the more free and popular one of
our days hath gradually taken place, and that
without any violence to the antient constitution<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span></p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>At least, my lord, with so little, that we
may, perhaps, apply to the <i>English</i> government
what the naturalists observe of the <small>HUMAN
BODY</small><a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>; that, when it arrives at its full
growth, it does not perhaps retain a single particle
of the matter it originally set out with;
yet the alteration hath been made so gradually
and imperceptibly, that the system is accounted
the same under all changes. Just so, I think,
we seem to have shaken off the constituent
parts of the <small>FEUDAL CONSTITUTION</small>; but, liberty
having been always the informing principle,
time and experience have rather completed
the old system, than created a new one:
and we may account the present and <i>Norman</i>
establishment all one, by the same rule as we
say that <span class="smcap">Hercules</span>, when he became the deliverer
of oppressed nations, was still the same
with him who had strangled serpents in his
cradle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span></p>

<h4>SIR. J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>I know not what fanciful similes your
younger wit may delight in. I content myself
with observing, that the two great points,
which they, who deny the liberty of the subject,
love to inculcate, and on which the plausibility
of all their reasonings depends, are,
<small>THE SLAVISH NATURE OF THE FEUDAL CONSTITUTION</small>,
and <span class="smcap">the late rise of the House of
Commons</span>. And I have taken up your time to
small purpose, if it doth not now appear, that
the <i>former</i> of these notions is false, and the
<i>latter</i> impertinent. If the learned inquirers
into this subject had considered that the question
is concerning the freedom itself of our
constitution, and not the most convenient form
under which it may be administered, they must
have seen that, the feudal law, though it narrowed
the system of liberty, was founded in
it; that the spirit of freedom is as vital in this
form, and the principles it goes upon as solid,
as in the best-formed republic; and that <i>villanage</i>
concludes no more against the <i>feudal</i>,
than <i>slavery</i> against the <i>Greek</i> or <i>Roman</i>,
constitutions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>That is, Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, you make <i>liberty</i> to have
been the essence of all <small>THREE</small>; though, to the
perfection of an equal commonwealth, you
suppose it should have been further spread out
and dilated: as they say of <i>frankincense</i> (if
you can forgive another allusion), which, when
lying in the lump, is of no great use or pleasure;
but, when properly diffused, is the
sweetest of all odours. But you was going on
with the application of your principles.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>I was going to say that, as many have been
misled by wrong notions of the <i>feudal tenures</i>,
others had erred as widely in their reasonings
on <i>the late origin of the lower house of parliament</i>.
How have we heard some men triumph,
in dating it no higher than the reign of
<span class="smcap">Edward III</span>? Let the fact be admitted.
What follows? That this house is an usurpation
on the prerogative? Nothing less. It
was gradually brought forth by time, and grew
up under the favour and good liking of our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
princes<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>. The constitution itself supposed the
men of greatest consequence in the commonwealth
to have a seat in the national councils.
Trade and agriculture had advanced vast numbers
into consequence, that before were of
small account in the kingdom. The public
consideration was increased by their wealth,
and the public necessities relieved by it. Were
these to remain for ever excluded from the
king’s councils? or was not that council, which
had liberty for its object, to widen and expand
itself in order to receive them? It did, in fact,
receive them with open arms; and, in so
doing, conducted itself on the very principles
of the old feudal policy.</p>

<p>In short, the <i>feudal constitution</i>, different
from all others that human policy is acquainted
with, was of such a make, that it readily gave
way, and fitted itself to the varying situations
of society: narrow and contracted, when the
public interest required a close connexion between
the governor and the governed; large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
and capacious, when the same interest required
that connexion to be loosened. Just as the
skin (if you will needs have a comparison),
the natural cincture of the body, confines the
young limbs with sufficient tightness, and
yet widens in proportion to their growth,
so as to let the different parts of the
body play with ease, and obtain their full size
and dimensions. Whereas the other policies,
that have obtained in the world, may be compared
to those artificial coverings, which, being
calculated only for one age and size; grow
troublesome and insupportable in any other;
and yet cannot, like these, be thrown off and
supplied by such as are more suitable and convenient;
but are worn for life, though with
constant, or rather increasing, uneasiness.</p>

<p>This then being the peculiar prerogative of
the feudal policy, I think we may say with
great truth, not that the House of Commons
violated the constitution, but, on the contrary,
that the constitution itself demanded, or rather
generated, the House of Commons.</p>

<p>So that I cannot by any means commend
the zeal which some have shewn in seeking the
origin of this house in the <i>British</i> or even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
<i>Saxon</i> annals. Their aim was, to serve the
cause of liberty; but, it must be owned, at the
expence of truth, and, as we now perceive,
without the least necessity.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>It hath happened then in this, as in so many
other instances, that an excellent cause hath
suffered by the ill judgment of its defenders.
But, when truth itself had been disgraced by
one sort of men in being employed by them to
the worst purposes, is it to be wondered that
others should not acknowledge her in such
hands, but be willing to look out for her in
better company?</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>Let us say, my lord, they should have acknowledged
her in whatever company she was
found; and the rather, as ill-applied truths are
seen to be full as serviceable to a bad cause, as
downright falsehoods. Besides, this conduct
had not only been fairer, but more politic.
For when so manifest a truth was rejected, it
was but natural to suspect foul play in the rest,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
and that none but a bad cause could want to be
supported by so disingenuous a management.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I think so, Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>; and there is this further
use of such candor, that it cuts off at once
the necessity of long and laboured researches
into the dark parts of our history; and so not
only shortens the debate, but renders it much
more intelligible to the people.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>I was aware of that advantage, and am therefore
not displeased that truth allowed me to
make use of it.&mdash;But to resume the main argument;
for I have not yet done with my evidence
for the freedom of our excellent constitution:&mdash;It
seemed of moment to shew, from
the nature and consequences of the <i>Norman</i>
settlement, that the <i>English</i> government was
essentially free. But, because the freest form
of government may be tamely given up and
surrendered into the hands of a master, I hold
it of consequence to prove, that the <i>English</i>
spirit hath always been answerable to the constitution,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
and that even the most insidious attempts
on their liberties have never failed to
awaken the resentment of our generous forefathers.
In a word, I would shew that the
jealously, with which the <i>English</i> have ever
guarded the national freedom, is at once a convincing
testimony of their <i>right</i>, and of their
constant <i>possession</i> of it.</p>

<p>And though I might illustrate this argument
by many other instances, I chuse to insist only
on <small>ONE, THEIR PERPETUAL OPPOSITION TO THE
CIVIL AND CANON LAWS</small>; which, at various times
and for their several ends, the crown and
church have been solicitous to obtrude on the
people.</p>

<p>To open the way to this illustration, let it
be observed that, from the time of <span class="smcap">Honorius</span>,
that is, when the <i>Roman</i> authority ceased
amongst us, the <i>Saxon</i> institutions, incorporated
with the old <i>British</i> customs, were the
only standing laws of the kingdom. These
had been collected and formed into a sort of
digest by <span class="smcap">Edward</span> the Confessor; and so great
was the nation’s attachment to them, that
<span class="smcap">William</span> himself was obliged to ratify them,
at the same time that the feudal law itself was
enacted. And afterwards, on any attempt to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
innovate on those laws, we hear of a general
outcry and dissatisfaction among the people:
which jealousy of theirs was not without good
grounds; as we may see from an affair that happened
in the Conqueror’s own reign, and serves
to illustrate the policy of this monarch.</p>

<p>It had been an old custom, continued
through the <i>Saxon</i> times, for the bishops and
sheriffs to sit together in judicature in the
county courts. This had been found a very
convenient practice; for the presence of the
churchmen gave a sanction to the determinations
of the temporal courts, and drew an extraordinary
reverence towards them from the
people. Yet we find it abolished by the Conqueror;
who, in a rescript to the bishop of
<i>Lincoln</i>, ordained that, for the future, the
bishops and aldermen of the shires should
have separate courts and separate jurisdictions.
The pretence for this alteration was
the distinct nature of the two judicatures,
and the desire of maintaining a strict conformity
to the canons of the church. The real
design was much deeper. There is no question
but <span class="smcap">William’s</span> inclinations, at least, were for
arbitrary government; in which project his
<i>Norman</i> lawyers, it was hoped, might be of
good use to him. But there was a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
obstacle in his way. The churchmen of those
times had incomparably the best knowledge of
the <i>Saxon</i> laws. It matters not, whether those
churchmen were <i>Normans</i>, or not. They were
equally devoted, as I observed before, to the
<i>Saxon</i> laws, with the <i>English</i>; as favouring
that independency, they affected, on the civil
power. Besides, in the Confessor’s time, many
and perhaps the greatest of the churchmen
had been <i>Normans</i>; so that the study of the
<i>Saxon</i> laws, from the interest they promised
themselves in them, was grown familiar to the
rising ecclesiastics of that country. Hence, as
I said, the churchmen, though <i>Normans</i>, were
well instructed in the spirit and genius of the
<i>Saxon</i> laws; and it was not easy for the king’s
glossers to interpret them to their own mind,
whilst the bishops were at hand to refute and
rectify their comments.</p>

<p>Besides, the truth is (and my lord of <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>
will not be displeased with me for telling
it), the ecclesiastics of that time were much
indevoted to the court. They considered the
king as the wickedest of all tyrants. He had
brought them into subjection by their baronies,
and had even set the pope himself at defiance.
In this state of things, there was no hope of
engaging the clergy in his plot. But when a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
separation of the two tribunals was made, and
the civil courts were solely administered by his
own creatures, the laws, it was thought, would
speak what language he pleased to require of
them.</p>

<p>Such appears to have been the design of this
prince in his famous distinction of the ecclesiastic
and temporal courts. It was so artfully
laid, and so well coloured, that the laity seem
to have taken no umbrage at it. But the
clergy saw his drift; and their zeal for the
ancient laws, as well as their resentments, put
them upon contriving methods to counteract
it. They hit upon a very natural and effectual
one. In a word, they all turned common
lawyers; and so found means of introducing
themselves into the civil courts. This expedient
succeeded so well, and was so generally
relished, that the clergy to a man almost in
the next reign were become professors of the
common law; <span class="smcap">nullus Clericus nisi Causidicus</span>,
as <span class="smcap">William</span> of <i>Malmesbury</i> takes care
to inform us<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span></p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>Whatever their motive might be, the churchmen,
I perceive, interposed very seasonably in
the support of our civil liberties. It was a
generous kind of revenge, methinks, to repay
the king’s tyranny over the church by vindicating
the authority of the <i>English</i> laws.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>It was so; and for this good service, I let
them pass without any harsher reflection.
Though the true secret is, perhaps, no more
than this: Their main object was the church,
of whose interests, as is fitting, we will allow
them to be the most competent judges. And,
as these inclined them, they have been, at different
junctures, the defenders or oppressors of
civil liberty.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>At <i>some</i> junctures, it may be, they have.
But, if you insist on so general a censure, I
must intreat Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span>, once more, to take
upon him the defence of our order.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span></p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>All I intended by this instance, was, to shew
the spirit of the <i>Saxon</i> laws, which could excite
the jealousy of the prince, and deserve, at
such a season, the patronage of the clergy. It
seems, however, for once, as if they had a little
misconceived their true interests. For the distinction
of the two judicatures, which occasioned
their resentment, was, in the end, a great
means of the hierarchical greatness and independency.</p>

<p>Matters continued on this footing during the
three first of the <i>Norman</i> reigns. The prince
did his utmost to elude the authority of the
<i>English</i> laws; and the nation, on the other
hand, laboured hard to confirm it. But a new
scene was opened under King <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>, by
means of the <i>Justinian</i> laws; which had lately
been recovered in <i>Italy</i>, and became at once
the fashionable study over all <i>Europe</i>. It is
certain, that the Pandects were first brought
amongst us in that reign; and that the reading
of them was much favoured by Archbishop
<span class="smcap">Theobald</span><a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>, under whose encouragement they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
were publicly read in <i>England</i> by <span class="smcap">Vacarius</span>,
within a short time after the famous <span class="smcap">Irnerius</span>
had opened his school at <i>Bologna</i>. There is
something singular in the readiness with which
this new system of law was embraced in these
Western parts of <i>Europe</i>. But my friend Mr.
<span class="smcap">Selden</span> used to give a plausible account of it.
It was, he said<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>, in opposition to <span class="smcap">Innocent II</span>,
who was for obtruding on the Christian states
the <i>decretals</i>, as laws; manifestly calculated
for the destruction of the civil magistrate’s
power. And what seems to authorize the
opinion of my learned friend, is, that the popes
very early took the alarm, and, by their decrees,
forbad churchmen to teach the civil
law: as appears from the constitution of <span class="smcap">Alexander
III</span>, so early as the year 1163, in the
council of <span class="smcap">Tours</span>; and afterwards from the
famous decretal of <span class="smcap">Super-specula</span> by <span class="smcap">Honorius
III</span>, in 1219, in which the clergy of all
denominations, seculars as well as regulars,
were prohibited the study of it. And it was,
doubtless, to defeat the mischief which the
popes apprehended to themselves, from the
credit of the imperial laws, that <span class="smcap">Gratian</span> was
encouraged, about the same time, to compose
and publish his <span class="smcap">Decree</span>; which, it is even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
said<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>, had the express approbation of Pope
<span class="smcap">Eugenius</span>.</p>

<p>Let us see, now, what reception this newly-recovered
law, so severely dealt with by the
pope, and so well entertained by the greatest
part of <i>Europe</i>, had in <i>England</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vacarius</span> had continued to teach it for some
time, in the archbishop’s palace at <i>Lambeth</i>,
to great numbers, whom first, the novelty of
the study, and then, the fashion of the age,
had drawn about him. The fame of the teacher
was high, and the new science had made a
great progress, when on a sudden it received a
severe check, and from a quarter whence one
should not naturally expect it. In short, the
king himself interdicted the study of it. Some
have imagined, that this inhibition was owing
to the spite he bore to archbishop <span class="smcap">Theobald</span>.
But the truer reason seems to be, that the canon
law was first read by <span class="smcap">Vacarius</span> at the same
time, and under colour of the imperial. I
think we may collect thus much very clearly
from <span class="smcap">John of Salisbury</span>, who acquaints us
with this edict. For he considers it as an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
offence against the church, and expressly calls
the prohibition, an <small>IMPIETY</small><a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>.</p>

<p>It is true, the decretals of <span class="smcap">Gratian</span> were not
yet published. But Ivo had made a collection
of them in the reign of <span class="smcap">Henry I</span>; and we may
be sure that some code of this sort would privately
go about amongst the clergy, from what
was before observed of the pains taken by <span class="smcap">Innocent
II</span>, to propagate the decretals. We
may further observe, that <span class="smcap">Theobald</span> had been
in high favour with <span class="smcap">Innocent</span>; and that his
school, at <i>Lambeth</i>, was opened immediately
on his return from <i>Rome</i>, whither he had been
to receive his pall from this pope, on his appointment
to the see of <i>Canterbury</i><a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>. All
which makes it probable, that <span class="smcap">Stephen’s</span> displeasure
was not so much at the civil, as <i>canon</i>
law, which he might well conclude had no
friendly aspect on his sovereignty.</p>

<p>And we have the greater reason to believe
that this was the fact, from observing what
afterwards happened in the reign of <span class="smcap">Henry III</span>,
when a prohibition of the same nature was
again issued out against the teachers of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
<i>Roman</i> laws in <i>London</i><a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>. The true cause of
the royal mandate is well known. <span class="smcap">Gregory IX</span>
had just then published a new code of the decretals;
which, like all former collections of this
sort, was calculated to serve the papal interest,
and depress the rights of princes.</p>

<p>However, these edicts, if we suppose them
levelled against the civil law, had no effect,
any more than those of the popes <span class="smcap">Alexander</span>
and <span class="smcap">Honorius</span>, before mentioned. For the
imperial law, being generally well received by
the princes of <i>Europe</i>, presently became a kind
of <i>Jus gentium</i>. And the clergy, who aspired
to power and dignities, either abroad or at
home, studied it with an inconceivable rage;
insomuch, that <span class="smcap">Roger Bacon</span> tells us, that,
in his time for forty years together, the seculars,
who were the ecclesiastics employed in
business, never published a single treatise in
divinity<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>.</p>

<p>The truth is, whatever shew the popes or
our own princes might make, at times, of discountenancing
the civil law, it was not the
design of either absolutely and universally to
suppress it. It was properly, not the civil, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
the canon law, which was discountenanced by
our kings. And the case of the popes was,
that, when they found the imperial law opposed
to the <i>common</i>, they were ready to favour it;
when it was opposed to the <i>canon</i>, and brought
that into neglect, they forbad ecclesiastics the
study of it.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>In the mean time the poor people, methinks,
were in a fine condition, between two laws,
the one founded on civil, and the other on ecclesiastical,
tyranny. If either had prevailed,
there had been an end of their liberties.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>Certainly their situation was very critical.
Yet in the end it was precisely this situation
that saved them. For betwixt these contentions
of the crown and mitre, each endeavouring to
extend its dominion over the other, the people,
who were of course to be gained by either side
in its distress, found means to preserve themselves
from both.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span></p>

<p>To see how this happened, we must remember,
what appears indeed from the two edicts
of <span class="smcap">Stephen</span> and <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, that the king himself
was a bulwark betwixt them and the papal
power. And when the king in his turn wanted
to exalt his prerogative over all, the church
very naturally took the alarm, as we saw in the
case of <span class="smcap">William’s</span> separation of the two tribunals.
And thus it happened, as <span class="smcap">Nat. Bacon</span>
observes<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>, “That many times the pope and
the clergy became protectors of the people’s
liberties, and kept them safe from the rage of
kings.” The greatest danger was, when the two
powers chanced to unite in one common design
against them; as they did in their general
inclination for the establishment of the civil
law. But here the people had the courage
always to defend themselves; and with that
wisdom too, as demonstrates their attention to
the cause of civil liberty, and the vigilance
with which they guarded even its remotest outworks.</p>

<p>Of their steady and watchful conduct, in
this respect, I shall mention some of the
many memorable examples, that occur in our
history.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span></p>

<p>I have said that from the time of <span class="smcap">Stephen</span>,
notwithstanding his famous edict, the imperial
laws were the chief and favourite study of the
clergy. They had good reason for applying
themselves so closely to this science, and still
further views than their own immediate advancement.
They wanted to bring those laws
into the civil courts, and to make them the
standing rule of public administration; not
merely from their good-will to the papal authority,
which would naturally gain an advantage
by this change, but for the sake of controlling
the too princely barons, and in hopes, no
doubt, that the imperial would in due time
draw the canon laws into vogue along with
them. Such, I think, were at least the secret
designs of the ruling clergy; and they did not
wait long before they endeavoured to put their
project in execution. The plot was admirably
laid, and with that deep policy as hath kept it,
I believe, from being generally understood to
this day.</p>

<p>The great men of that time were, we may be
sure, too like the great men of every other, to
be very scrupulous about the commission of
those vices to which they were most inclined.
The truth is, their profligacy was in proportion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
to their greatness and their ignorance. They
indulged themselves in the most licentious
amours, and even prided themselves in this
licence. The good churchmen, no doubt, lamented
this corruption of manners; but, as
they could not reform, they resolved at least to
draw some emolument to themselves from it.
The castles of the barons, they saw, were full
of bastards. Nay, the courtesy of that time
had so far dignified their vices, that the very
same was had in honour. <span class="smcap">Ego Gulielmus
Bastardus</span>, is even the preamble to one of
<span class="smcap">William</span> the First’s charters.</p>

<p>Yet, as respectable as it was become, there
was one unlucky check on this favourite indulgence:
and this, with the barons leave, the
considerate bishops would presently take off.
Subsequent marriage, by the imperial as well
as canon laws, legitimated bastards, as to succession;
whereas the common law kept them
eternally in their state of bastardy. It is not
to be doubted, but the barons would be sensible
enough of this restraint. They earnestly wished
to get rid of it. And could any thing bid so
fair to recommend the imperial law to their
good liking, as the tender of it for so desirable
a purpose? At a parliament, therefore, under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
<span class="smcap">Henry III</span><a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a>, <i>Rogaverunt omnes episcopi, ut
consentirent quod nati ante matrimonium essent
legitimi</i>. What think ye now of this
general supplication of the hierarchy? What
could the barons do but comply with it, especially
as it was so kindly intended for their relief,
and the proposal was even made with a
delicacy that might enable them to come into
it with a good grace, and without the shame
of seeming to desire it? All this is very true.
Yet the answer of the virtuous barons is as
follows: <i>Omnes comites et barons un&acirc; voce
responderunt</i>, <span class="smcap">Quod nolumus leges Angli&aelig;
mutari</span>.</p>

<p>We see then what stuck with them. These
barons, as licentious as they were, preferred
their liberty to their pleasure. The bishops,
they knew, as partisans of the pope, were for
subjecting the nation to the imperial and papal
laws. They offered, indeed, to begin with a
circumstance very much to their taste. But if
they accepted the benefit of them in one instance,
with what decency could they object
to them in others? They determined therefore
to be consistent. They rejected a proposition,
most agreeable in itself, lest their acceptance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
of it should make way for the introduction of
foreign laws; whose very genius and essence,
they well knew, was arbitrary, despotic power.
Their answer speaks their sense of this matter,
<span class="smcap">Nolumus leges Angli&aelig; mutari</span>. They had
nothing to object to the proposal itself. But
they were afraid for the constitution.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I doubt, Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, my lord of <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>
will bring a fresh complaint against you, for
this liberty with the bishops. But I, who
shall not be thought wanting in a due honour
for that bench, must needs confess myself
much pleased, as well with the novelty, as
justice of this comment. I have frequently
considered this famous reply of the old barons.
But I did not see to the bottom of the contrivance.
Their aversion to the imperial laws,
as you say, must have been very great, to have
put them on their guard against so inviting a
proposal.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>One thing, however, is forgotten or dissembled
in this account, that the law of <span class="smcap">Justinian</span>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
which allows the privilege of legitimation
to subsequent marriage, is grounded on
some reasons that might, perhaps, recommend
it to the judgment, as well as interest of the
old prelates. Besides, they doubtless found
themselves much distressed by the contrariety
of the two laws in this instance. For the
ground of their motion, as I remember, was,
<i>Quod esset secundum communem formam ecclesi&aelig;</i>.
But, to deal ingenuously with you,
Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, you have dressed up your hypothesis
very plausibly. And I, who am no advocate
for the civil or ecclesiastical laws, in this or
any instance where they clash with those of my
country, can allow your raillery on <span class="smcap">Henry’s</span>
good bishops, if it were only that I see it
makes so much for your general argument.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>Your lordship may the rather excuse this
liberty with the <i>church</i>, as I propose, in due
time, to deal as freely with <span class="smcap">Westminster-hall</span>;
a similar plot, which I shall have occasion
to mention presently, having been formed
against the ancient constitution by the men
of our profession.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span></p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>In the mean time, Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, you must give
me leave, in quality of advocate for the church,
to observe one thing, that does the churchmen
honour. It is, that, in these attempts on the
constitution, the judges and great officers of
the realm, who in those times were of the
clergy, constantly took the side of the <i>English</i>
laws; as my Lord <span class="smcap">Coke</span> himself, I remember,
takes notice in his commentary on this statute
of <span class="smcap">Merton</span>.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>I believe the observation is very just. But
I should incline to impute this integrity, not
to the influence of church principles, but those
of the common law, and so turn your compliment
to the honour of our profession instead of
theirs, if it were not too clear in fact that
every profession, in its turn, hath been liable
to this charge of corruption.</p>

<p>But I was going on with my proofs of the
national aversion to the imperial law.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span></p>

<p>The next shall be taken from that famous
dispute concerning the succession to the crown
of <i>Scotland</i> in the reign of <span class="smcap">Edward I</span>. For
a question arising about the kind of law by
which the controversy should be decided, and
it being especially debated, whether the <i>C&aelig;sarean</i>
law, as a sort of <i>jus gentium</i>, ought
not in such a cause to have the preference to
the law of <i>England</i>; it was then unanimously
determined by the great council of <span class="smcap">Norham</span>,
that the authority of the <i>C&aelig;sarean</i> law should
by no means be admitted; <span class="smcap">ne inde majestatis
Anglican&aelig; juri fieret detrimentum</span><a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>.</p>

<p>This determination was public, and given
on a very solemn occasion. And in general
we may observe, that at the junctures when
the state hath been most jealous of its liberty
and honour, it hath declared the loudest
against the <i>imperial laws</i>: as in the <small>WONDER-WORKING</small>
parliament under <span class="smcap">Richard II</span>, when
the duke of <i>Gloucester</i> accused the archbishop
of <i>York</i>, the duke of <i>Ireland</i>, and other creatures
of the king, of high treason. The
charge was so fully proved, that the court had
no other way of diverting the storm, than by
pretending an irregularity in the forms of procedure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
To this end the lawyers were consulted
with, or more properly directed. I will disguise
nothing. They descended so much from
the dignity of their profession, as to act in perfect
subserviency to the views of the court;
and therefore gave it as their opinion, that the
proceedings against the lords were of no validity,
as being contrary to the forms prescribed
by the <i>civil law</i>. The barons took themselves
to be insulted by these shifts of the lawyers.
They insisted that the proceedings were agreeable
to their own customs, and declared roundly
that they would never suffer <i>England</i> to be
governed by the <i>Roman</i> civil law<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>.</p>

<p>What think ye now of these examples? Are
they not a proof that the spirit of liberty ran
high in those times, when neither the intrigues
of churchmen nor the chicane of lawyers could
put a stop to it? It seems as if no direct
attempts on the constitution could have been
made with the least appearance of success; and
that therefore the abettors of arbitrary power
were obliged to work their way obliquely, by
contriving methods for the introduction of a
foreign law.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>

<p>In this project they had many advantages,
which nothing but an unwearied zeal in the
cause of liberty could have possibly counteracted.
From the reign of <span class="smcap">Stephen</span> to that of
<span class="smcap">Edward III</span>, that is, for the space of near
200 years, the <i>Roman</i> law had been in great
credit<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>. All the learning of the times was in
the clergy, and that learning was little more
than the imperial and canon laws. The fact
is so certain, that some of the clergy themselves,
when in an ill temper, or off their
guard, complain of it in the strongest terms.
And to see the height to which this humour
was carried, not the seculars only who intended
to rise by them, but the very monks in their
cells studied nothing but these laws<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>. To
complete the danger, the magistracies and
great offices of the kingdom were filled with
churchmen<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>.</p>

<p>Who would expect, now, with those advantages,
but that the <i>Roman</i> law would have
forced its way into our civil courts? It did indeed
insinuate itself there as it were by stealth,
but could never appear with any face of authority.
The only service, that would be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
accepted from it, was that of illustration only in
the course of their pleadings, whilst the lawyers
quoted occasionally from the <span class="smcap">Institutes</span>, just
as they might have done from any other ancient
author<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>. Yet, so long as the churchmen presided
in the courts of justice, this intruder was
to be respected; and it is pleasant to observe
the wire-drawing of some of our ablest lawyers,
in their endeavours to make the policy of <i>England</i>
speak the language of <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Selden’s</span> dissertation on <span class="smcap">Fleta</span><a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>, which
lies open before me, affords a curious instance.
The civil law says, “Populus ei [C&aelig;sari] et in
eum omne suum imperium et potestatem conferat;”
meaning by <i>people</i>, the <i>Roman</i> people,
and so establishing the despotic rule of the
prince. But <span class="smcap">Bracton</span> took advantage of the
ambiguity, to establish that maxim of a free
government, “That all dominion arises from
the people.” This, you will say, was good
management. But what follows is still better.
“Nihil aliud, says he, potest rex in terris,
cum sit Dei minister et vicarius, nisi quod
JURE potest. <span class="smcap">Nec obstat</span> quod dicitur, <small>QUOD
PRINCIPI PLACET LEGIS HABET VIGOREM</small>; quia
sequitur in fine legis, <span class="smcap">CUM LEGE REGIA QU&AElig;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
DE IMPERIO EJUS LATA EST</span>; id est, non quicquid
de voluntate regis temer&egrave; pr&aelig;sumptum
est, sed quod consilio magistratuum suorum,
rege auctoritatem pr&aelig;stante, et habit&acirc; super
hoc deliberatione et tractatu, rect&egrave; fuerit definitum.”
Thus far old <span class="smcap">Bracton</span>; who is religiously
followed in the same gloss by <span class="smcap">Thornton</span>,
and the author of <span class="smcap">Fleta</span>. But what!
you will say, this is an exact description of the
present constitution. It is so, and therefore
certainly not to be found in the civil law. To
confess the truth, these venerable sages are
playing tricks with us. The whole is a premeditated
falsification, or, to say it softer, a
licentious commentary, for the sake of <i>English</i>
liberty. The words in the <span class="smcap">Pandects</span> and <span class="smcap">Institutions</span>
are these; “<small>QUOD PRINCIPI PLACUIT,
LEGIS HABET VIGOREM, UTPOTE CUM LEGE
REGIA, QU&AElig; DE IMPERIO EJUS LATA EST, POPULUS
EI ET IN EUM OMNE SUUM IMPERIUM ET
POTESTATEM CONFERAT</small>.”</p>

<p>My honest friend, in mentioning this extraordinary
circumstance, says, one cannot consider
it <i>sine stupore</i>. He observes, that these
lawyers did not quote the Pandects by hearsay,
but had copies of them; and therefore
adds (for I will read on) “Unde magis mirandum
qu&acirc;nam ratione evenerit, ut non sol&ugrave;m
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
ipse, ade&ograve; judiciis forensibus clarus, et (si Biographis
scriptorum nostratium fides) professor
juris utriusque Oxoniensis, ver&ugrave;m etiam <span class="smcap">Thorntonius</span>
juris ali&agrave;s peritissimus, et <span class="smcap">Flet&aelig;</span> author,
ade&ograve; diversam lectionem sensumque diversum
atque interpretibus aliis universis ade&ograve;
alienum in illustrissimo juris C&aelig;sarei loco explicando
tam fident&egrave;r admiserint.” The difficulty,
you see, increases upon him. But we
shall easily remove it by observing, that the
C&aelig;sarean laws, though they had no proper
authority with us, yet were much complimented
in those times, and were to be treated
on all occasions with ceremony. And therefore
those lawyers that lived under and wanted
to support a free constitution, saw there was
no way of serving their cause so effectually,
as by pretending to find it in the <i>Roman institutes</i>.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>This management of <span class="smcap">Bracton</span> and his followers
makes some amends for the ill conduct
of <span class="smcap">Richard</span> the Second’s lawyers. And as to
their chicanery, the ingenuity of the gloss, we
will suppose, was no more than necessary to
correct the malignity of the text.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span></p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>They had, no doubt, consulted their honour
much more, by insisting roundly, as they
might have done, that the text had no concern
at all in the dispute. But I mention these
things only to shew the extreme reverence,
that was then paid to the civil law, by the
shifts the common lawyers were put to in order
to evade its influence. From which we learn
how rooted the love of liberty must have been
in this nation, and how unshaken the firmness
of the national councils in supporting it, when,
notwithstanding the general repute it was of in
those days, the imperial law could never gain
authority enough to prescribe to us in any matters
that concerned the rights of the crown, or
the property of the subject. And this circumstance
will be thought the more extraordinary,
if it be considered, that, to the general esteem
in which the <i>Roman</i> law was held by the clergy,
our kings have usually added the whole weight
of their influence; except indeed at some particular
junctures, when their jealousy of the
<i>canon</i> law prevailed over their natural bias to
the <i>civil</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span></p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I should be unwilling to weaken any argument
you take to be of use in maintaining the
noble cause you have undertaken. But, methinks,
this charge on our princes would require
to be made out by other evidence<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> than
hath been commonly produced for it. There
is no doubt but many of them have aimed at
setting themselves above the laws of their
country; but is it true (I mean, though <span class="smcap">Fortescue</span>
himself<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> has suggested the same thing)
that for this purpose they have usually expressed
a partiality to the <i>Roman</i> laws?</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>I believe it certain that they have, and on
better reasons than the bare word of any lawyer
whatsoever.</p>

<p>What think you of <span class="smcap">Richard</span> the Second’s
policy in the instance before mentioned; that
<span class="smcap">Richard</span>, who used to declare, “That the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
laws were only in his mouth and breast, and
that he himself could make and unmake them
at his pleasure?” We may know for what reason
a prince of this despotic turn had recourse
to the <i>Roman</i> law.</p>

<p>But even his great predecessor is known to
have been very indulgent towards it. And still
earlier, <span class="smcap">Edward I.</span> took much pains to establish
the credit of this law; and to that end
engaged the younger <span class="smcap">Accursius</span>, the most renowned
doctor of the age, to come over into
<i>England</i>, and set up a school of it at <i>Oxford</i>.
Or, to wave these instances, let me refer you
to a certain and very remarkable fact, which
speaks the sense, not of this or that king, but
of the whole succession of our princes.</p>

<p>The imperial law, to this day, obtains altogether
in the courts of admiralty, in courts
marescall, and in the universities<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>. On the
contrary, in what we call the courts of law and
equity, it never hath, nor ever could prevail.
What shall we say to this remarkable difference?
or to what cause will you ascribe it,
that this law, which was constantly excluded
with such care from the one sort of courts,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
should have free currency and be of sole authority
in the other? I believe it will be difficult
to assign any other than this: that the subjects
of decision in the first species of courts are
matters in the resort of the king’s prerogative,
such as peace and war, and the distribution of
honours; whilst the subjects of decision in the
courts of common law are out of his prerogative,
such as those of liberty and property.
The king had his choice by what law the first
sort of subjects should be regulated; and therefore
he adopted the imperial law. He had not
his choice in the latter instance; and the people
were never satisfied with any other than the law
of the land.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>Yet Mr. <span class="smcap">Selden</span>, you know, gives another
reason of this preference: it was, he thinks,
because foreigners are often concerned with
the natives in those tribunals where the civil
law is in use.</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>True; but my learned friend, as I conceive,
did not attend to this matter with his usual
exactness. For foreigners are as frequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
concerned in the courts of law and equity, as
in the other tribunals. The case in point of
reason is very clear. In all contests that are
carried on between a native and a foreigner,
as the subject of another state, the decision
ought to be by the law of nations. But when
a foreigner puts himself with a native under
the protection of our state, the determination
is, of course, by our law. The practice hath
uniformly corresponded to the right in the
courts of law and equity. In the other tribunals
the right hath given way to the will of the
prince, who had his reasons for preferring the
authority of the imperial law.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, if we consider the veneration,
which the clergy usually entertained, and
endeavoured to inculcate into the people, for
the civil law; the indulgence shewn it by the
prince; its prevalence in those courts which
were immediately under the prerogative; and
even the countenance shewn it at times in the
course of pleading at common law; we cannot
avoid coming to this short conclusion, “That
the genius of the imperial laws was repugnant
to our constitution; and that nothing but the
extreme jealousy of the barons, lest they might
prove, in pleas of the crown, injurious to civil
liberty, hath kept them from being received
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
in <i>England</i> on the same footing that we every
where find they are in the other countries of
<i>Europe</i>, and as they are in <i>Scotland</i> to this
day.”</p>

<p>But, if you think I draw this conclusion too
hastily, and without grounding it on sufficient
premises, you may further consider with me,
if you please, <small>THE FATE AND FORTUNES OF THE
CIVIL LAW IN THIS KINGDOM DOWN TO THE PRESENT
TIME</small>.</p>

<p>In the reigns of <span class="smcap">Henry VII</span><a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> and VIII, and
the two first kings of the house of <span class="smcap">Stuart</span>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
that is, the most despotic of our princes, the
study of the civil law hath been more especially
favoured; as we might conclude from the general
spirit of those kings themselves, but as
we certainly know from the countenance they
shewed to its professors; from their chusing
to employ them in their business, and from
the salaries and places they provided for their
encouragement. Yet see the issue of all this
indulgence to a foreign law, and the treatment
it met with from our parliaments and people!
The oppressions of <span class="smcap">Empson</span> and <span class="smcap">Dudley</span> had
been founded in a stretch of power, usurped
and justified on the principles of the civil law;
by which these miscreants had been enabled to
violate a fundamental part of our constitution,
the way of <i>trial by</i> <small>JURIES</small>. The effect on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
people was dreadful. Accordingly, in the entrance
of the next reign, though the authority,
by which they had acted, had even been parliamentary,
these creatures of tyranny were
indicted of high treason, were condemned and
executed for having been instrumental in subverting
<span class="smcap">LEGEM TERR&AElig;</span>; and the extorted statute,
under which they had hoped to shelter
themselves, was with a just indignation repealed.</p>

<p>Yet all this was considered only as a necessary
sacrifice to the clamours of an incensed
people. The younger <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, we may be
sure, had so much of his father in him, or rather
so far outdid him in the worst parts of his
tyranny, that he could not but look with an
eye of favour on the very law he had been
constrained to abolish. His great ecclesiastical
minister was, no doubt, in the secret of his
master’s inclinations, and conducted himself
accordingly. Yet the vengeance of the nation
pursued and overtook him in good time. They
resented his disloyal contempt of the original
constitution; and made it one of the articles
against this <i>Roman</i> cardinal, “That he endeavoured
to subvert <i>antiquissimas leges hujus
regni, universumque hoc regnum</i> <small>LEGIBUS IMPERIALIBUS</small>
<i>subjicere</i>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span></p>

<p>From this time, the study of the civil law
was thought to languish in <i>England</i>, till it revived
with much spirit in the reigns of those
unhappy princes who succeeded to the house
of <span class="smcap">Tudor</span>. Then indeed, by inclination and
by pedantry, <span class="smcap">James I.</span> was led to patronize
and encourage it. And the same project was
resumed, and carried still further, by his unfortunate
son. I speak now from my own experience
and observation. The civil lawyers
were most welcome at court. They were
brought into the Chancery and court of Requests.
The minister, another sort of man
than <span class="smcap">Wolsey</span>, yet a thorough ecclesiastic, and
bigoted, if not to the religion; yet to the policy
of <i>Rome</i>, gave a countenance to this profession
above that of the common law. He
had found the spirit, and even the forms of it,
most convenient for his purpose in the <span class="smcap">Star-chamber</span>
and <span class="smcap">High-commission</span> court, those
tribunals of imperial justice, exalted so far
above the controul of the common law; and
by his good will, therefore, would have brought
the same regimen into the other branches of
the administration. Great civilians were employed
to write elaborate defences of their science;
to the manifest exaltation of the prerogative;
to the prejudice of the national rights
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
and privileges; and to the disparagement of
the common law. The consequence of these
proceedings is well known. The most immediate
was, that they provoked the jealousy of
the common lawyers; and, when the rupture
afterwards happened, occasioned many of the
most eminent of them to throw themselves into
the popular scale<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, to see the uniformity of the views of
tyranny, and the direct opposition which it
never fails to encounter from the <i>English</i> law,
no sooner had a set of violent men usurped the
liberties of their country, and with the sword
in their hands determined to rule despotically
and in defiance of the constitution, than the
same jealousy of the common law, and the
same contempt of it, revived. Nay, to such an
extreme was the new tyranny carried, that the
very game of <span class="smcap">Empson</span> and <span class="smcap">Dudley</span> was played
over again. The trial of an <i>Englishman</i> by
his peers was disgraced and rejected; and (I
speak from what I felt) the person imprisoned
and persecuted, who dared appeal, though in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
his own case<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>, to the ancient essential forms
of the constitution. Under such a state of
things, it is not to be wondered that much
pains was taken to depreciate a law which these
mighty men were determined not to regard.
Invectives against the professors of the <i>English</i>
laws were the usual and favoured topics of parliamentary
eloquence. These were sometimes
so indecent, and pushed to that provoking
length, that <span class="smcap">Whitlocke</span> himself, who paced
it with them through all changes, was forced
in the end to hazard his reputation with his
masters, by standing on the necessary defence
of himself and his profession<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>.</p>

<p>I need not, I suppose, descend lower. Ye
have both seen with your own eyes the occurrences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
of the late reign. Ye have heard the
common language of the time. The practice
was but conformable to such doctrines as were
current at court, where it was generally maintained,
that the king’s power of dispensing with
law, was <small>LAW</small>; by which if these doctors did
not intend the <i>imperial</i> or <i>civil law</i>, the insult
was almost too gross to deserve a confutation,
It must be owned, and to the eternal
shame of those who were capable of such baseness,
there were not wanting some even of the
common lawyers that joined in this insult.</p>

<p>I but touch these things slightly; for I consider
to whom I speak. But if, to these examples
of the nation’s fondness for their laws,
you add, what appears in the tenor of our histories,
the constant language of the <i>coronation-oaths</i>,
of the <i>oaths of our judges</i>, and,
above all, of the <i>several great charters</i>; in all
which express mention is made of the <span class="smcap">LEX
TERR&AElig;</span>, in opposition to every foreign, but especially
the C&aelig;sarean, law; you will conclude
with me, “That, as certainly as the <span class="smcap">C&aelig;sarean
law</span> is founded in the principles of slavery,
our <span class="smcap">English law</span>, and the constitution to
which it refers, hath its foundation in freedom,
and, as such, deserved the care with which it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
hath been transmitted down to us from the
earliest ages.”</p>

<p>What think ye now, my good friends? Is
it any longer a doubt, that the constitution of
the <i>English</i> government, such I mean as it
appears to have been from the most unquestioned
annals of our country, is a free constitution?
Is there any thing more in the way of
this conclusion? or does it not force itself upon
us, and lie open to the mind of every plain
man that but turns his attention upon this
subject?</p>

<p>You began, Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span>, with great fears
and apprehensions; or you thought fit to
counterfeit them, at least. You suspected the
matter was too mysterious for common understandings
to penetrate, and too much involved
in the darkness of ancient times to be brought
into open day-light. Let me hear your free
thoughts on the evidence I have here produced
to you. And yet it is a small part only of that
which might be produced, of that I am sure
which yourself could easily have produced, and
perhaps expected from me.</p>

<p>But I content myself with these obvious
truths, “That the liberty of the subject appears,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
and of itself naturally arose, from the
very nature of the <small>FEUDAL</small>, which is properly
(at least if we look no further back than the
Conquest) the <i>English</i> constitution; that the
current of liberty has been gradually widening,
as well as purifying, in proportion as it descended
from its source; that charters and
laws have removed every scruple that might
arise about the reciprocal rights and privileges
of prince and people; that the sense of that
liberty which the nation enjoyed under their
admirable constitution was so quick, that every
the least attempt to deprive them of it gave an
alarm; and their attachment to it so strong
and constant, that no artifice, no intrigue, no
perversion of law and gospel, could induce
them to part with it: that, in particular, they
have guarded this precious deposite of legal
and constitutional liberty with such care, that,
while the heedless reception of a foreign law,
concurring with other circumstances, hath
riveted the yoke of slavery on the other nations
of <i>Europe</i>, this of <i>England</i> could never be
cajoled nor driven into any terms of accommodation
with it; but, as <span class="smcap">Nat. Bacon</span><a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> said
truly, <i>That the triple crown could never well
solder with the English</i>, so neither could the
<i>imperial</i>; and that, in a word, the <span class="smcap">English</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
<small>LAW</small> hath always been preserved inviolate from
the impure mixtures of the canon and C&aelig;sarean
laws, as the sole defence and bulwark
of our civil liberties.”</p>

<p>These are the plain truths, which I have
here delivered to you, and on which I could
be content to rest this great cause; I mean, if
it had not already received its formal, and, I
would hope, final determination, in another
way. For no pretences will surely prevail
hereafter with a happy people to renounce that
liberty, which so rightfully belonged to them
at all times, and hath now so solemnly been
confirmed to them by the great transactions of
these days. I willingly omit therefore, as superfluous,
what in a worse cause might have
been thought of no small weight, the express
testimony of our ablest lawyers to the freedom
of our constitution. I do not mean only the
<span class="smcap">Cokes</span> and <span class="smcap">Seldens</span> of our time (though in
point of authority what names can be greater
than theirs?); but those of older and therefore
more reverend estimation, such as <span class="smcap">Glanvil</span>,
<span class="smcap">Bracton</span>, the author of <span class="smcap">Fleta</span>, <span class="smcap">Thornton</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Fortescue</span><a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>: men the most esteemed and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
learned in their several ages; who constantly
and uniformly speak of the <i>English</i>, as a mixed
and limited form of government, and even go
so far as to seek its origin, where indeed the
origin of all governments must be sought, in the
free will and consent of the people.</p>

<p>All this I might have displayed at large; and
to others perhaps, especially if the cause had
required such management, all this I should
have displayed. But, independently of the
judgments of particular men, which prejudice
might take occasion to object to, I hold it sufficient
to have proved from surer grounds, from
the very form and make of our political fabric,
and the most unquestioned, because the most
public, monuments of former times, “<span class="smcap">That
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
the English constitution is assuredly and
indisputably free</span><a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>.”</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>You will read, Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, in our attention to
this discourse, the effect it has had upon us.
The zeal, with which you have pleaded the
cause of liberty, makes me almost imagine I
see you again in the warmth and spirit of your
younger years, when you first made head
against the encroachments of civil tyranny.
The same cause has not only recalled to your
memory the old topics of defence, but restores
your former vigour in the management of them.
So that, for myself, I must freely own, your
vindication of our common liberties is, at least,
the most plausible and consistent that I have
ever met with.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span></p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>And yet, if one was critically disposed, there
are still, perhaps, some things that might deserve
a further explanation.&mdash;But enough has
been said by you, Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, to shew us where
the truth lies: and, indeed, from such plain
and convincing topics, that, whatever fears my
love of liberty might suggest, they are much
abated at least, if not entirely removed, by your
arguments.</p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Somers</span>, I perceive, is not easily cured
of his scruples and apprehensions. But for
my own part, Sir <span class="smcap">John</span>, I can think but of
one objection of weight that can be opposed
to your conclusion. It is, “That, notwithstanding
the clear evidence you have produced,
both for the free nature of the <i>English</i> constitution,
and the general sense of the <i>English</i>
nation concerning it, yet, in fact, the government
was very despotic under the <span class="smcap">Tudor</span>,
and still more perhaps under the first princes
of the <span class="smcap">Stuart</span>, line. How could this happen,
may it be asked, on your plan, which supposes
the popular interest to have been kept
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
up in constant vigour, or rather to have been
always gaining, insensibly indeed, but necessarily,
on the power of the crown? Will not
the argument then from historical evidence be
turned against you, whilst it may be said that
your theory, however plausible, is contradicted
by so recent and so well-attested a part of our
history? And, in particular, will not the partisans<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>
of the late king and his family have to
allege in their behalf, that their notions of the
prerogative were but such as they succeeded to
with the crown; and, whatever may be pretended
from researches into remoter times,
that they endeavoured only to maintain the
monarchy on the footing on which it had stood
for many successions, and on which it then
stood when the administration fell into their
hands? If this point were effectually cleared,
I see nothing that could be further desired
to a full and complete vindication of <i>English</i>
liberty.”</p>

<h4>SIR J. MAYNARD.</h4>

<p>Your lordship, I must own, has touched a
very curious and interesting part of our subject.
But you must not believe it was so much overlooked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
by me, as purposely left for your lordship’s
better consideration. You, who have
looked so minutely and carefully into the story
of those times, will, better than any other, be
able to unfold to us the mysteries of that affair.
The fact is certain, as you say, that the
<i>English</i> government wore a more despotic appearance
from the time of the <span class="smcap">Tudor</span> family’s
accession to the throne, than in the reigns
preceding that period. But I am mistaken, if
your lordship will not open the reason of it so
clearly as to convince us, that that increase of
prerogative was no proof of a change in the
constitution, and was even no symptom of declining
liberty. I do not allow myself to speak
my sentiments more plainly at present. But
I am sure, if they are just, they will receive
a confirmation from what your lordship will
find occasion to observe to us in discoursing
op this subject.</p>

<h4>MR. SOMERS.</h4>

<p>I will not disown that this was one of the
matters I had in view, when I hinted some remaining
doubts about your general conclusion.
But I knew it would not escape my lord of
<span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>, who, of all others, is certainly the
most capable of removing it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span></p>

<h4>BP. BURNET.</h4>

<p>So that I have very unwarily, it seems, been
providing a fine task for myself. And yet, as
difficult as I foresee it will be for me to satisfy
two such Inquirers, I should not decline that
task, if I was indeed prepared for it, or if I
could boast of such a memory as Sir <span class="smcap">J. Maynard</span>
has shewn in the course of this conversation.
But the truth is, though I have not
wanted opportunities of laying in materials
for such a design, and though I have not
neglected to take some slight notes of them,
yet I cannot pretend to have them at once in
that readiness, as to venture on such a discourse
as I know you expect from me. But if, against
our next meeting, I shall be able to digest
such thoughts as have sometimes occurred to
me when I was engaged in the History of the
Reformation, I shall take a pleasure to contribute
all I can to the further and more entire
elucidation of this subject.</p>

A curious passage, or two, in his Letters to Atticus, will
serve to illustrate this observation. The <i>academic questions</i> were
drawn up, and finished, when a doubt occurred to him, whether
he should not change one of the speakers in that Dialogue, and,
instead of Varro, introduce Brutus; who would suit his purpose,
he said, just as well, because his philosophic principles
were the same with those of Varro&mdash;<i>si addubitas</i>, says he to
Atticus, <i>ad Brutum transeamus. Est enim is quoque Antiochius.</i>
l. xiii. 25. Was this a change to be easily made, if it were necessary,
in this kind of writing, to suit the <i>style</i> and <i>manner of
expression</i> to the character of the speakers? Yet, hear how
negligently he treats this matter&mdash;<i>Opinor igitur consideremus,
etsi nomina jam facta sunt. Sed</i> <small>VEL INDUCI, VEL MUTARI POSSUNT</small>.
l. xiii. 14.&mdash;In other words, provided the <i>cast</i> of the
several parts was the same, the <i>language</i> of the Dialogue would
require no alteration. It was indifferent, in this respect, who
were the speakers.</p></div>

That of <i>Secretary of State</i>. The Lord <span class="smcap">Clarendon</span> tells
us it was with the utmost difficulty he persuaded him to
accept it. “There were two considerations (says the historian)
that made most impression on him; the <i>one</i>, lest
the world should believe that his own ambition had procured
this promotion, and that he had therefore appeared
signally in the house to oppose those proceedings, that he
might thereby render himself gracious to the court: The
<i>other</i>, lest the king should expect such a submission and
resignation of himself and his own reason and judgment
to his commands as he should never give or pretend to
give; for he was so severe an adorer of truth, that he
would as easily have given himself leave to steal as to dissemble,”

which (now there were so few that used it, and

who were gone upon pretence, that they were not suffered

The writer of the Dialogue has thought fit to soften
the misanthropy of Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowley</span> in this instance. In one
of his Essays he talks strangely. “It is the great boast,”
says he, “of eloquence and philosophy, that they first
congregated men dispersed, united them into cities, and
built up the houses and the walls of cities. I wish they
could unravel all they had woven, that we might have our
woods and our innocence again, <i>instead of our castles and
our policies</i>.”</p></div>

himself to Mr. M. <span class="smcap">Clifford</span>] we have often heard Mr.
<span class="smcap">Cowley</span> admire him, not only for the profoundness of
his knowledge, which was applauded by all the world, but

regarded, for <i>his generosity of mind, and his neglect of the

contrary to expectation, this very attempt raised a storm

<span class="smcap">Lord Bacon</span> gives another account of this matter.&mdash;“As
for the privateness of life of contemplative men, it
is a theme so common to extol a private life, not taxed
with sensuality and sloth, in comparison, and to the disadvantage
of a civil life, for safety, liberty, pleasure, and
dignity, <i>as no man handleth it, but handleth it well</i>: such
a consonancy it hath to men’s conceits in the expressing,
and to men’s consents in the allowing.” [<i>Adv. of Learning</i>,

The justness of this encomium on Lord <span class="smcap">Clarendon</span>
will hardly be disputed by any man, whose opinion is
worth regarding.&mdash;What pity, that Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowley’s</span> connexions
with some persons, indevoted to the excellent
Chancellor, kept him at a distance from a man, so congenial
to himself, and for whom he could not but entertain
the highest esteem! The Chancellor, though he could
not be expected to take him out of the hands of his old
patrons, seems, yet, to have been generous enough to Mr.
<span class="smcap">Cowley</span>, not to resent those connexions: as may be gathered
from the handsome testimony paid to his merit, in
the <i>Continuation of the History of his own Life</i>. Speaking
of <span class="smcap">B. Jonson</span>, he says&mdash;“He [<span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span>] was the best
judge of, and fittest to prescribe rules to, poetry and
poets, of any man who had lived with, or before him, or
since; <i>If Mr.</i> <span class="smcap">Cowley</span> <i>had not made a flight beyond all
men</i>; with that modesty yet, to ascribe much of this, to
the example and learning of <span class="smcap">Ben Jonson</span>.”&mdash;Among the
other infelicities of men of genius, <small>ONE</small> is, and not the
least, that it rarely happens to them to have the choosing
of the persons, to whom they would most wish to be
obliged. The sensibility of their gratitude being equal to
their other parts and virtues, the man, whose favour they
chance first to experience, is sure of their constant services
and attachment through life, how strongly soever their
interest, and even their judgment, may <i>draw</i> another
way.</p></div>

Whether it were owing to his other occupations, or
that he had no great confidence in the success of this

passion in metre, while the queen came within his ward,
burst out in a great pang of impatience to see such uncouth
trudging to and fro, such riding in and out, with
such din and noise of talk, within his charge; whereof he
never saw the like, nor had any warning once, ne yet
could make to himself any cause of the matter. At last,
upon better view and advertisement, he proclaims open

his office and all, and on his knees humbly prays pardon

slaves, than in that age, wherein great men kept
open houses for all comers and goers: and that in our
age, wherein we have better learned each man to live of
his own, and great men keep not such troops of idle
servants, not only the English are become very industrious

of lords and gentlemen is abated, whereby they nourished

politician of the last century expresseth himself to much
the same purpose, after his manner: “Henceforth, says
he, [that is, after the statutes against retainers in <span class="smcap">Hen.
VII’s</span> reign] the country lives, and <i>great tables</i> of the nobility,
which no longer nourished veins that would bleed
for them, were fruitless and loathsome till they changed
the air, and of princes became <i>courtiers</i>; where their revenues,
never to have been exhausted by beef and mutton,
were found <i>narrow</i>; whence followed racking of rents,
and, at length, sale of lands.” <span class="smcap">Sir James Harrington’s
Oceana</span>, p. 40. <i>Lond.</i> 1656.</p></div>

True it is, that this divertisement of <i>bear-baiting</i> was
not altogether unknown in the age of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, and,
as it seemeth, not much misliked of master <span class="smcap">Stow</span> himself,
who hath very graphically described it. He is speaking
of the <i>Danish</i> embassador’s reception and entertainment
at <i>Greenwich</i> in 1586. “As the better sort, saith
he, had their convenient disports, so were not the ordinary
people excluded from competent pleasure. For, upon
a green, very spacious and large, where thousands might
stand and behold with good contentment, their <small>BEAR-BAITING</small>
and bull-baiting (tempered with other merry
disports) were exhibited; whereat it cannot be spoken of
what pleasure the people took.</p>

<p>For it was a sport alone, of these beasts, continueth
the historian, to see the bear with his pink-eyes leering
after his enemies; the nimbleness and wait of the dog to
take his advantage; and the force and experience of the
bear again to avoid the assaults; if he were bitten in one
place, how he would pinch in another to get free; and if
he were once taken, then what shift with biting, clawing,
roaring, tugging, grasping, tumbling, and tossing, he would
work to wind himself away; and, when he was loose, to
shake his ears with the blood and slaver about his phisnomy,
was a pittance of good relief. The like pastime
also of the bull.&mdash;And now the day being far spent, and
the sun in his declination, the embassador withdrew to
his lodging by barge to <span class="smcap">Crosby’s</span> place; where, no doubt,
<small>THIS DAY’S SOLEMNITY WAS THOUGHT UPON AND TALKED
OF</small>.”&mdash;p. 1562.</p></div>

If the reader be complaisant enough to admit the
fact, it may be accounted for, on the ideas of chivalry,
in the following manner. The knight forfeited all pretensions
to the favour of the ladies, if he failed, in any
degree, in the point of valour. And, reciprocally, the
claim which the ladies had to protection and courtesy
from the order of knights, was founded singly in the reputation
of chastity, which was the female point of honour.
“Ce droit que les dames avoient sur la chevalerie (says
<span class="smcap">M. de la Curne de Ste Palaye</span>) devoit &eacute;tre conditionel;
il supposoit que leur conduite et leur reputation ne les
rendoient point indignes de l’espece d’association qui les
unissoit &agrave; cet ordre uniquement fond&eacute; sur l’honneur.</p>

<p>Par celle voye (says an old <i>French</i> writer, the chevalier
<span class="smcap">de la Tour</span>, about the year 1371) les bonnes se craignoient
et se tenoient plus fermes de faire chose dont elles
peussent perdre leur honneur et leur etat. <i>Si vouldroye
que cel&ucirc;i temps fust revenu, car je pense qu’il n’en seroit pas
tant de blasm&eacute;es comme il est &agrave; present.”</i></p></div>

What is hinted, here, of the <i>reality</i> of these representations,
hath been lately shewn at large in a learned
memoir on this subject, which the reader will find in the
<small>XX</small><sup>th</sup> Tom. of <span class="smcap">Hist. de l’Acad. des Inscriptions et

This representation of things in the ages of chivalry
agrees with what we are told by the author of the memoir
just quoted: “Les premi&egrave;res le&ccedil;ons,” (says he, speaking
of the manner in which the youth were educated in the
houses of the Great, which were properly the schools of
those times) “qu’on leur donnoit, regardoient principalement
<i>l’amour de Dieu, et des dames</i>, c’est-&agrave;-dire, la
religion, et la galanterie. Mais autant la d&eacute;votion qu’on
leur inspiroit &eacute;toit accompagn&eacute;e de puerilit&eacute;s et de superstitions,
autant l’amour des dames, qu’on leur recommandoit,
&eacute;toit il rempli de <small>RAFFINEMENT</small> et de <small>FANATISME</small>.
Il semble qu’on ne pouvoit, dans ces si&eacute;cles ignorans et
grossiers, pr&eacute;senter aux hommes la religion sous une
forme assez materielle pour la mettre &agrave; leur port&eacute;e; ni
leur donner, en m&ecirc;me tems, une id&eacute;e de l’amour assez
pure, assez metaphysique, pour prevenir les desordres et
les exc&egrave;s, dont etoit capable une nation qui conservoit
par-tout le caractere impetueux qu’elle montroit &agrave; la
guerre.” Tom. xx. p. 600.</p>

<p>One sees then the origin of that furious gallantry which
runs through the old romances. And so long as the <i>refinement
and fanaticism</i>, which the writer speaks of, were
kept in full vigour by the force of institution and the
fashion of the times, the morals of these enamoured
knights might, for any thing I know, be as pure as their
apologist represents them. At the same time it must be
confessed that this discipline was of a nature very likely to
relax itself under another state of things, and certainly to
be misconstrued by those who should come to look upon
these pictures of a <i>refined and spiritual passion</i>, as incredible
and fantastic. And hence, no doubt, we are to account
for that censure which a famous writer, and one of the
ornaments of <span class="smcap">Elizabeth’s</span> own age, passeth on the old
books of chivalry. His expression is downright, and somewhat
coarse. “In our fathers time nothing was read but
books of chivalry, wherein a man by reading should be
led to none other end, but only to <i>manslaughter</i> and <i>baudrye</i>.
If any man suppose they were good enough to pass
the time withall, he is deceived. For surely vain words
do work no small thing in vain, ignorant, and young
minds, especially if they be given any thing thereunto of
their own nature.” He adds, like a good Protestant,
“These books, as I have heard say, were made the most
part in abbayes and monasteries; a very likely and fit fruit
of such an idle and blind kind of living.” <i>Pr&aelig;f.</i> to <span class="smcap">Ascham’s
Toxophilus</span>, 1571.</p>

<p>I thought it but just to set down this censure of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Ascham</span> over-against the candid representation of the
French memorialist.&mdash;However, what is said of the influence,
which this ancient institution had on the character
of his countrymen, is not to be disputed. “Les preceptes
d’amour repandoient dans le commerce des dames ces considerations
et ces egards respectueux, qui, n’ayant jamais
&eacute;t&eacute; effac&eacute;s de l’esprit des Fran&ccedil;ois, ont toujours fait un des
caract&egrave;res distinctifs de n&ocirc;tre nation.”</p></div>

This romantic spirit of the Queen may be seen as well
in her <i>amours</i>, as military achievements. “Ambiri, coli

voluit; de <small>FABULOSIS INSULIS</small> per illam relaxationem

generos&egrave; per <small>VIRTUTEM</small> exercebant.”</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Thuani</span> Hist. tom. vi. p. 172.</p>

<p>The observation of the great historian is confirmed by
<span class="smcap">Francis Osborne</span>, Esq., who, speaking of a contrivance
of the Cecilian party to ruin the earl of <span class="smcap">Essex</span>, by giving
him a rival in the good graces of the queen, observes&mdash;“But
the whole result concluding in a duel, did rather inflame
than abate the former account she made of him:
the opinion of a <small>CHAMPION</small> being more splendid (in the
weak and romantic sense of women, that admit of nothing
fit to be made the object of a quarrel but themselves) and
far above that of a captain or general. So as Sir <span class="smcap">Edmund
Cary</span>, brother to the Lord <span class="smcap">Hunsdon</span>, then chamberlain
and near kinsman to the Queen, told me, that though she
chid them both, nothing pleased her better than a conceit
she had, that her <i>beauty</i> was the subject of this quarrel,
when, God knows, it grew from the stock of honour, of
which then they were very tender.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mem. of Q. Elizabeth</span>,
p. 456.</p>

<p>But nothing shews the romantic disposition of the
Queen, and indeed of her times, more evidently than the
<small>TRIUMPH</small>, as it was called; devised and performed with
great solemnity, in honour of the <i>French</i> commissioners in
1581. The contrivance was for four of her principal
courtiers, under the quaint appellation of “four foster-children
of <small>DESIRE</small>,” to besiege and carry, by dint of arms,
“<span class="smcap">the fortress of Beauty</span>;” intending, by this courtly
&aelig;nigma, nothing less than the queen’s majesty’s own person.&mdash;The
actors in this famous triumph were, the Earl
of <span class="smcap">Arundel</span>, the Lord <span class="smcap">Windsor</span>, Master <span class="smcap">Philip Sidney</span>,
and Master <span class="smcap">Fulk Grevil</span>. And the whole was conducted
so entirely in the spirit and language of knight errantry,
that nothing in the Arcadia itself is more romantic.
See the account at large in <span class="smcap">Stow’s</span> continuation of
<span class="smcap">Holinshed’s</span> Chronicles, p. 1316-1321.</p>

<p>To see the drift and propriety of this triumph, it is to
be observed that the business which brought the <i>French</i>
commissioners into <i>England</i> was, the great affair of the
queen’s marriage with the duke of <span class="smcap">Alan&ccedil;on</span>.</p></div>

There was an instance of this kind, and perhaps the
latest upon record in our history, in the 13th year of the
queen, when “a combat was appointed to have been
fought for a certain manor, and demain lands belonging
thereto, in <i>Kent</i>.” The matter was compromised in the
end. But not till after the usual forms had been observed,
by the two parties: of which we have a curious and circumstantial
detail in <i>Holinshed’s</i> Chronicles, p. 1225.</p></div>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Camden</span> owns that the <i>Irish</i> rebellion, which in

[<i>Hist. of</i> <span class="smcap">Eliz.</span> B. iv.]&mdash;To the same purpose another
eminent writer of that time&mdash;“Before the transmitting of
the last great army, the forces sent over by <span class="smcap">Q. Elizabeth</span>
were <small>NOT</small> of sufficient power to break and subdue all the
<i>Irishry</i>.” At last, however, “The extreme peril of losing
the kingdom; the dishonour and danger that might
thereby grow to the crown of <i>England</i>; together with a
just disdain conceived by that great-minded queen, that
so wicked and ungrateful a rebel should prevail against
her, who had ever been victorious against all her enemies;
did move and almost <small>ENFORCE</small> her to send over
that mighty army.” [Sir. <span class="smcap">J. Davies</span>, <i>Discovery of the State

This <i>reverence of authority</i>, one of the characteristics
of that time, and which Mr. <span class="smcap">Addison</span> presently accounts
for, a great writer celebrates in these words&mdash;“It was an
ingenuous uninquisitive time, when all the passions and
affections of the people were lapped up in such an innocent
and humble obedience, that there was never the least contestation
nor capitulation with the queen, nor (though
she very frequently consulted with her subjects) <i>any further
reasons urged of her actions than</i> <small>HER OWN WILL</small>.”
See a tract intitled <span class="smcap">The Disparity</span>, in Sir <span class="smcap">H. Wotton’s</span>

<span class="smcap">Paulus Hentznerus</span>, a learned <i>German</i>, who was in

the queen’s skill in languages. He tells us, that, “pr&aelig;terquam
qu&ograve;d Gr&aelig;c&egrave; et Latin&egrave; eleganter est docta, tenet,
ultra jam memorata idiomata, etiam Hispanicum, Scoticum,

<p>But this was the general character of the great in that
reign: at least, if we may credit Master <span class="smcap">William Harrison</span>,
who discourseth on the subject before us in the
following manner: “This further is not to be omitted,
to the singular commendation of both sorts and sexes of
our courtiers here in <i>England</i>, that there are very few of
them, which have not the use and skill of sundry speeches,
beside an excellent vein of writing, before time not regarded.
Truly it is a rare thing with us now, to hear of
a courtier which hath but his own language. And to say
how many gentlewomen and ladies there are, that, beside
sound knowledge of the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> tongues, are
thereto no less skilful in the <i>Spanish</i>, <i>Italian</i>, and <i>French</i>,
or in some one of them, it resteth not in me; sith I am
persuaded, that as the noblemen and gentlemen do surmount
in this behalf, so these come very little or nothing
behind them for their parts; which industry God continue,
and accomplish that which otherwise is wanting.” <span class="smcap">Descript.</span>

One of these <i>ties</i> was the <i>prejudice of education</i>; and
some uncommon methods used to bind it fast on the
minds of the people.&mdash;A book, called ΕΙΡΗΝΑΡΧΙΑ, sive
<span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>, was written in <i>Latin</i> verse by one <span class="smcap">Ockland</span>,
containing the highest panegyrics on the queen’s character
and government, and setting forth the transcendant virtues
of her ministers. This book was enjoined by authority
to be taught, as a classic author, in Grammar-schools, and
was of course to be gotten by heart by the young scholars
throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>This was a matchless contrivance to imprint a sense of
loyalty on the minds of the people. And, though it flowed,
as we are to suppose, from a tender regard, in the advisers
of it, for the interests of Protestantism in that reign; yet
its uses are so apparent in any reign, and under any administration,
that nothing but the moderation of her successors,
and the reasonable assurance of their ministers
that their own acknowledged virtues were a sufficient support
to them, could have hindered the expedient from
being followed.</p>

<p>But, though the stamp of public authority was wanting,
private men have attempted, in several ways, to supply
this defect. To instance only in one. The Protestant
queen was to pass for a mirror of <i>good government</i>: hence
the Εἰρηνάρχια. Her successor would needs be thought a
mirror of <i>eloquence</i>: and hence the noble enterprise I am
about to celebrate. “Mr. <span class="smcap">George Herbert</span> (I give it in
the grave historian’s own words) being prelector in the
rhetorique school in <i>Cambridge</i>, in 1618, passed by those
fluent orators, that domineered in the pulpits of <i>Athens</i>
and <i>Rome</i>, and insisted to read upon an oration of <span class="smcap">K.
James</span>, which he analysed; shewed the concinnity of the
parts; the propriety of the phrase; the height and power
of it to move the affections; the style, <small>UTTERLY UNKNOWN
TO THE ANCIENTS</small>, who could not conceive what kingly
eloquence was, in respect of which those noted demigogi
were but hirelings and tribolary rhetoricians.” Bishop

<i>Ireland</i>, and his <i>View of the state of that country</i>, that his
talents for <i>business</i> (such as <span class="smcap">Cecil</span> himself must have approved)
were no less considerable than for poetry. But he
had served a disgraced man; and had drawn upon himself
the admiration of the generous earl of <i>Essex</i>. So that, as
the historian expresseth it, “by a fate which still follows
poets, he always wrestled with poverty, though he had
been secretary to the lord <span class="smcap">Gray</span>, lord deputy of <i>Ireland</i>.”
All that remained for him was, “to be interred at <i>Westminster</i>,
near to <span class="smcap">Chaucer</span>, at the charge of the earl of <i>Essex</i>;
his hearse being attended by poets, and mournful elegies
and poems, with the pens that wrote them, thrown into

for her neglect of this gentleman. “She did acknowledge
(says the earl of <i>Essex</i> in a letter to Mr. <span class="smcap">Francis Bacon</span>)
you had a great wit, and an excellent gift of speech, and
much other good learning. But in <span class="smcap">Law</span>, she rather thought
you could make shew, to the utmost of your knowledge,
than, that you were deep.” <span class="smcap">Mem. of Q. Elizabeth</span> by
Dr. <span class="smcap">Birch</span>; to whom the public is exceedingly indebted
for abundance of curious information concerning the history
of those times.</p>

<p>If it be asked, how the queen came to form this conclusion,
the answer is plain. It was from Mr. <span class="smcap">Bacon’s</span>
having a <small>GREAT WIT</small>, an excellent <small>GIFT OF SPEECH</small>, and
much other <small>GOOD LEARNING</small>.</p>

<p>It is true, Sir <span class="smcap">Francis Bacon</span> himself gives another
account of this matter. In a letter of advice to Sir.
<span class="smcap">George Villiers</span>, he says, “In this dedication of yourself
to the public, I recommend unto you principally
that which I think was never done since I was born&mdash;that
you countenance and encourage and advance <small>ABLE MEN</small>, in
all kinds, degrees, and professions. For in the time of
the <span class="smcap">Cecils</span>, father and son, <small>ABLE MEN WERE BY DESIGN
AND OF PURPOSE SUPPRESSED</small>.” <span class="smcap">Cabala</span>, p. 57, ed. 1691.&mdash;But
either way, indeed, the queen’s character is equally
saved.</p></div>

The lord <span class="smcap">Mountjoy</span> [then Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Blount</span>],
being of a military turn, had stolen over into <i>France</i>, without
the queen’s knowledge, in order to serve in <i>Bretagne</i>,
under one of her generals. Upon his return, which was
hastened too by her express command, “Serve me so again,
said the queen, once more, and I will lay you fast enough
for running. You will never leave, till you are knocked
o’ the head, as that inconsiderate fellow <span class="smcap">Sidney</span> was. You
shall go when I send you. In the mean time see that you
lodge in the Court, where you may <small>FOLLOW YOUR BOOKS,
HEAD, AND DISCOURSE OF THE WARS</small>.” Sir <span class="smcap">Robert

So good a judge of military matters, as Sir <span class="smcap">Walter
Raleigh</span>, was of this opinion with regard to the conduct
of the <i>Spanish</i> war. “If the late queen would have believed
her men of war, as she did her scribes, we had, in
her time, beaten that great empire in pieces, and made
their kings, kings of figs and oranges, as in old times.
But <i>her majesty did all by halves</i>, and, by petty invasions,
taught the <i>Spaniard</i> how to defend himself, and to see his
own weakness; which, till our attempts taught him, was
hardly known to himself.” See his Works, vol. i. 273.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Raleigh</span>,
it may be said, was of the <span class="smcap">Cecil</span> faction.
But the men of war, of the <span class="smcap">Essex</span> faction, talked exactly
in the same strain; which shews that this might probably
be the truth.</p></div>

See Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Wotton’s</span> <i>Parallel of the earl of

[the earl of <i>Essex</i>] was to wrestle with a queen’s declining,
or rather with her very setting age, as we may term it;
which, besides other respects, is commonly even of itself
the more umbratious and apprehensive; as for the most
part all horizons are charged with certain vapours towards
their evening.” <span class="smcap">Remains</span>, p. 11.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_97" href="#FNanchor_97" class="label">97</a>
This account of her policy is confirmed by what we
read in the <span class="smcap">Disparity</span>, before cited. “That trick of
countenancing and protecting factions (as that queen,
almost her whole reign, did with singular and equal demonstration
of grace look upon several persons of most
distant wishes one towards another) was not the least
ground of much of her quiet and success. And she never
doubted but that men, that were never so opposite in
their good-will each to other, or never so dishonest in
their projectments for each other’s confusion, might yet
be reconciled in their allegiance towards her. Insomuch
that, during her whole reign, she never endeavoured to
reconcile any personal differences in the court, though
the unlawful emulations of persons of nearest trust about
her, were ever like to overthrow some of her chiefest
designs: <i>A policy, seldom entertained by princes, especially
if they have issues to survive them</i>,” p. 46. Her own historian,
it is true, seems a little shy of acknowledging this
conduct of the queen, with regard to her nobility and ministers.
But he owns, “She now and then took a pleasure
(and not unprofitably) in the emulation and privy
grudges of her women.” <span class="smcap">Camden’s Elizabeth</span>, p. 79.

Something like this was observed of her disposition

the queen of <i>Scots</i>, the strong professions of friendship
which the queen of <i>England</i> had made to him, “She
[the queen of <i>Scots</i>] inquired, says he, whether I thought
that queen meant truly towards her inwardly in her heart,
as she appeared to do outwardly in her speech. I answered
freely, that, in my judgment, there was neither plain
dealing, nor upright meaning; but great dissimulation,
emulation, and <small>FEAR</small>, lest her princely qualities should
over-soon chace her from her kingdom,” &amp;c. <span class="smcap">Memoirs</span>,

has the following words&mdash;“<i>Remember</i>, I humbly beseech

I would to God I had no cause to think, that <i>it might put

the Lord Treasurer himself (we are told) in a letter still
extant in the paper-office, written in the critical year 1588,
while the <i>Spanish</i> armada was expected against <i>England</i>,
excuses himself to sir <span class="smcap">Edward Stafford</span>, then embassador
in <i>France</i>, for not writing to him oftener, <i>on account

One of these complaisant observers was the writer of

of the queen’s houses, checks himself with saying, “But

what houses the queen’s majesty hath? Sith <small>ALL IS HIRS</small>;
and when it pleaseth hir in the summer season to recreate
hirself abroad, and view the state of the countrie, and hear
the complaints of hir unjust officers or substitutes, <i>every

Perhaps they had no need of such favours: It seems
as if they had provided for themselves another way. One
of her ladies, the Lady <span class="smcap">Edmondes</span>, had been applied to
for her interest with the queen in a certain affair of no
great moment, then depending in the Court of Chancery.
The person, commissioned to transact this matter with her
ladyship, had offered her 100<i>l.</i> which she treated <i>as too
small a sum</i>. The relater of this fact adds&mdash;“This ruffianry
of causes I am daily more and more acquainted
with, and see the manner of dealing, which cometh of the
<i>queen’s straitness</i> to give these women, whereby they presume
thus to grange and truck causes.” See a letter in
<span class="smcap">Mem.</span> of <span class="smcap">Q. Elizabeth</span>, by Dr. <span class="smcap">Birch</span>, vol. i. p. 354.
But this 100<i>l.</i> as the virtuous Lady <span class="smcap">Edmondes</span> says, was <i>a
small sum</i>. It appears, that bishop <span class="smcap">Fletcher</span>, on his
translation to <i>London</i>, “bestowed in allowances and gratifications
to divers attendants [indeed we are not expressly
told, they were <i>female</i>] about her majesty, the sum of
3100<i>l.</i> which money was given by him, for the most part
of it, <i>by her majesty’s direction and special appointment</i>.”
Mem. vol. ii. p. 113. And the curiosity is, to find this
minute of episcopal <i>gratifications</i> in a petition presented
to the queen herself, “To move her majesty in commiseration
towards the orphans of this bishop.”&mdash;However, to
do the ladies justice, the contagion of bribery was so general
in that reign, that the greatest men in the court
were infected by it. The lord-keeper <span class="smcap">Puckering</span>, it
seems, had a finger in the affair of the 100<i>l.</i>; nay, himself
speaks to the lady to get him commanded by the queen to
favour the suit. And we are told, that Sir <span class="smcap">W. Raleigh</span>
had no less than 10,000<i>l.</i> for his interest with the queen
on a certain occasion, after having been invited to this
service by the finest letter that ever was written.&mdash;Indeed
it is not said how much of this secret service money went
<i>in allowances and gratifications to the attendants about the
queen’s majesty</i>, vol. ii. p. 497.</p></div>

Lord <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> made the same excuse for <i>his</i> bribery;
as he had learnt, perhaps, the trade itself from his royal
mistress. It was a rule with this great chancellor, “Not

See <i>Hist. Collections</i>, by <span class="smcap">H. Townshend</span>, Esq.; p.
268. <i>Lond.</i> 1680.&mdash;The lord-keeper too, in a speech in the
star-chamber, confirms this charge on the country justices.
“The thirst, says he, after this authority, proceedeth
from nothing but an ambitious humour of gaining
of reputation amongst their neighbours; that still, when
they come home, <i>they may be presented with presents</i>.”

When the queen declared to Sir <span class="smcap">James Melvil</span> her
resolution of virginity, “I know the truth of that, madam,
(said he); you need not tell it me. Your majesty thinks,
if you were married, you would be but queen of <i>England</i>;
and now you are both king and queen. <i>I know your spirit
cannot endure a commander.</i>” <span class="smcap">Mem.</span> p. 49. This was frank.
But Sir <span class="smcap">James Melvil</span> was too well seen in courts to have
used this language, if he had not understood it would be
welcome. Accordingly, the queen’s highness did not seem
displeased with the imputation.</p></div>

This was a common topick of complaint against the

<p>But a bishop of that time carries the charge still further.
In one of his sermons at court before the queen,
“Parsonages and vicarages, says he, seldom pass now-a-days
from the patron, but either for the lease, or the present
money. Such merchants are broken into the church
of God, a great deal more intolerable than were they
whom <span class="smcap">Christ</span> whipped out of the temple.”&mdash;This language
is very harsh, and surely not deserved by the Protestant
patrons of those days, who were only, as we may suppose,
for reducing the church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span> to its pure and primitive
state of indigence and suffering. How edifying is it to
hear St. <span class="smcap">Paul</span> speak of his being&mdash;<i>In hunger and thirst,
in fastings often, in cold and nakedness!</i> And how perfectly
reformed would our church be, if its ministers were but
once more in this blessed apostolical condition!</p></div>

This casual remark seems to determine a famous dispute

Bishop <span class="smcap">Nicolson</span> attended so little to this tralatitious use
of words, in which all languages abound, that finding
<span class="smcap">Laga</span> in several places signified a <i>country</i>, he would needs
have it that <span class="smcap">Camden</span>, <span class="smcap">Lambarde</span>, <span class="smcap">Spelman</span>, <span class="smcap">Cowell</span>,
<span class="smcap">Selden</span>, and all our best Antiquaries, were mistaken,
when they supposed <i>Laga</i> ever signified, in the compositions
here mentioned, a <i>law</i>. However, his adversaries
among the Antiquaries were even with him; and finding
that <i>Laga</i>, in these compositions, did signify a law in several
places of our ancient laws, historians, and lawyers,
deny that it ever signifies a <i>country</i>. Each indeed had a
considerable object in view; the one was bent on overthrowing
a system; the other on supporting it; namely,
that famous threefold body of laws, the <i>Danish</i>, <i>Mercian</i>,
and <i>West-Saxon</i>. It must be owned, the bishop could not
overthrow the common system, without running into his
extreme: it seems, his opponents might have supported it
without running into theirs.</p></div>

The speaker might have begun this account of the
<i>fate and fortunes</i> of the civil law still higher. <span class="smcap">Nat. Bacon</span>,
speaking of <span class="smcap">Henry</span> the Fifth’s reign, observes, “The
times were now come about, wherein light began to spring
forth, conscience to bestir itself, and men to study the
scriptures. This was imputed to the idleness and carelessness
of the clergy, who suffered the minds of young
scholars to luxuriate into errors of divinity, for want of
putting them on to other learning; and gave no encouragement
to studies of human literature, by preferring
those that were deserving. The convocation taking this
into consideration, do decree, that no person should exercise
any jurisdiction in any office, as <i>vicar-general</i>,
<i>commissary</i>, or <i>official</i>, or otherwise, unless he shall first
in the university have taken degrees in the <small>CIVIL OR CANON
LAWS</small>. A shrewd trick this was, to stop the growth of
the study of divinity, and <span class="smcap">Wickliff’s</span> way; and to embellish
men’s minds with a kind of learning that may gain
them preferment, or at least an opinion of abilities beyond
the common strain, and dangerous to be meddled with.
Like some gallants, that wear swords as badges of honour,
and to bid men beware, because they possibly may
strike, though in their own persons they may be very
cowards. And no less mischievously intended was this
against the rugged <small>COMMON LAW</small>, a rule so nigh allied to
the gospel-way, as it favoureth liberty; and so far estranged
from the way of the civil and canon law, as there is no
hope of accommodation till Christ and Antichrist have
sought the field.” <span class="smcap">Disc.</span> Part II. p. 90. <i>Lond.</i> 1739.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_151" href="#FNanchor_151" class="label">151</a>
It should however be observed, in honour of their
patriotism, that “they afterwards took themselves out of
it,” when they saw the extremities to which the popular
party were driving.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_152" href="#FNanchor_152" class="label">152</a>
This alludes to the proceedings against the <i>eleven
members</i> upon the charge of the Army. Sir <span class="smcap">John Maynard</span>
was one of them. And when articles of high treason
were preferred against him, and the trial was to come
on before the lords, he excepted to the jurisdiction of the
court, and, by a written paper presented to them, required
to be tried by his peers according to <i>Magna Charta,
and the law of the land</i>. See <span class="smcap">Whitlocke’s</span> <i>Memorials</i>; and
a short pamphlet written on that occasion, called <span class="smcap">The
Royal Quarrel</span>, dated 9th of <i>Feb.</i> 1647.&mdash;Sir <span class="smcap">John</span> was,
at this time, a close prisoner in the Tower.</p></div>

The reader may not be displeased to see the words of
old <span class="smcap">Fortescue</span> on this subject of the origin of the <i>English</i>
government, which are very remarkable. In his famous
book <i>De laudibus legum Angli&aelig;</i>, he distinguishes between
the <small>REGAL</small> and <small>POLITICAL</small> forms of government. In explaining
the <i>latter</i>, which he gives us as the proper form of
the <i>English</i> government, he expresseth himself in these
words&mdash;“Habes instituti omnis <small>POLITICI REGNI</small> formam, ex
qu&acirc; metiri poteris potestatem, quam rex ejus in leges ipsius
aut subditos valeat exercere: ad tutelam namque legis
subditorum, ac eorum corporum et bonorum rex hujusmodi
erectus est, et hanc potestatem <small>A POPULO EFFLUXAM</small>

It may be of little moment to us, at this day, to inquire,
how far the princes of the house of <span class="smcap">Stuart</span> were
blameable for their endeavours to usurp on the constitution.
But it must ever be of the highest moment to
maintain, that we had a constitution to assert against
them. Party-writers perpetually confound these two
things. It is the author’s purpose, in these two Dialogues,
to contend for the <i>latter</i>.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
